    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"> <p>On October 1st 2014, Dries announced at DrupalCon Amsterdam that Drupal 8 had reached Beta 1, a significant milestone in the journey to Drupal 8.  </p>
<div>He also revealed that 2,300 individuals have contributed to the Drupal 8 project. Pretty impressive - but hard to imagine, right?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One of our Drupal developers here at CTI decided to create a visualisation to express the flurry of activity before, during and after DrupalCon, which has culminated in this significant achievement. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The video Adam created helps communicate the true scale of the project. Enjoy…</div>
