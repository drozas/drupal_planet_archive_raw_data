    <p>Today is <a href="http://www.givingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a>, "a global day dedicated to giving back."</p>
<p>Drupal's tagline is "Come for the software, stay for the community." I'd like to ask you to consider supporting the <a href="http://www.teachyourselfdrupal.org">Teach Yourself Drupal</a> Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vegantriathlete/teach-yourself-drupal">campaign</a> to create a free totally open source online Drupal training product. By backing this project, you will be giving a gift that keeps on giving back to the Drupal community.</p>
