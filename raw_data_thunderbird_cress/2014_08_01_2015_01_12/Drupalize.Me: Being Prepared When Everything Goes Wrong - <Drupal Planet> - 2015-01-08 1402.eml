An incident response plan is all about being prepared. So that in the moment, under pressure, when everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong, you can remain calm, cool, and level-headed. If you've ever had to write a social media message, or respond to a support request during an un-planned site outage you know how easy it can be to misstepâ€”even if your intentions are good.</p>
