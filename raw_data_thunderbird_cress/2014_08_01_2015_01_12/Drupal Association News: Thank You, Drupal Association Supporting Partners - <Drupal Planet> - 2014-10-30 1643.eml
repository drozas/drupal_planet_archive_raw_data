So, today, we’d like to express gratitude for our unbelievably fantastic Supporting Partners.</p>
<p>Without contributions from partners like <a href="http://exove.com" target="_blank">Exove</a>, <a href="http://www.duoconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Duo Consulting</a>, <a href="http://chapterthree.com/" target="_blank">Chapter Three</a>, <a href="http://lullabot.com" target="_blank">Lullabot</a>, <a href="http://www.chromaticsites.com/" target="_blank">Chromatic</a>, <a href="https://chillco.com/" target="_blank">The Cherry Hill Company</a>, <a href="http://www.elevatedthird.com/" target="_blank">Elevated Third</a>, and <a href="http://www.technocrat.com.au/" target="_blank">Technocrat</a>, we wouldn’t be able to do what we love: serve the Drupal community and help make Drupal great. Our partners are helping us fund improvements to Drupal.org.</p>
<p>Our partners are making several key intiatives for Drupal.org possible, including:</p>
<ul><li>
		Better account creation and login</li>
	<li>
		Organization and user profile improvements</li>
	<li>
		Responsive redesign of Drupal.org</li>
	<li>
		Issue workflow and Git improvements</li>
	<li>
		Make Drupal.org search usable</li>
	<li>
		Improved tools to find and select projects</li>
	<li>
		Groups migration to Drupal 7</li>
</ul><p>In addition to major projects, Supporting Partner contributions make the ongoing work to sustain and maintain Drupal.org happen:</p>
<ul><li>
		We performed user research to guide our work on new features and improvements;</li>
	<li>
		We are starting work on a comprehensive content strategy for Drupal.org;</li>
	<li>
		We’ve bought and installed new server hardware to improve performance and responsiveness;</li>
	<li>
		We are improving development environments to make development for Drupal.org faster and more efficient;</li>
	<li>
		We have faster testbot instances for Drupal 8 development and contribution sprints;</li>
	<li>
		We implemented content delivery networks (CDN) for Drupal.org and downloads;</li>
	<li>
		We are improving behavior driven development (BDD) tests to ensure Drupal.org deployments are successful and error free, and many more.</li>
</ul><p>This is only a small portion of the many improvements we’ve been able to make with the help of our Supporting Partners. From helping us make Drupal.org better to making it easier than ever to give back, the Drupal Association’s many wonderful Supporting Partners are some of the heroes of the Drupal project.</p>
