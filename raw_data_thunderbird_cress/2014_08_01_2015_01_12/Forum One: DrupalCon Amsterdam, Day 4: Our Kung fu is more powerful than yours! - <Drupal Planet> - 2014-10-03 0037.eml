<p>Campbell and I presented our session, <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/coder-vs-themer-ultimate-grudge-smackdown-fight-death">Coder vs. Themer</a>, Thursday morning and it was a huge success! The gist of the session was this: Campbell and I are both martial artists in addition to Drupalists, and we drew comparisons between our respective martial arts (Ninjitsu and Kung fu) and our respective Drupal roles (coder and themer). Then we both attempted, in real time, to build a Drupal site from a markup. I could only use the theme layer and Campbell could only use the code/module layer. The 302 attendees were more than spectators, they were active participants, cheering us on when we found clever solutions and booing when we took hacky shortcuts! Who won?!</p>

We dubbed this follow-up <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/bof/coder-vs-themer-fight-club">Coder vs. Themer: Fight Club</a>, and in it the attendees are divided into small development teams, each containing at least one coder and one themer. We then challenged them to collaborate and build out mockups. We had the luxury of having Augustin Delaporte and Robert Douglass of Commerce Guys there to provide development servers on their <a href="http://platform.sh">platform.sh</a> hosting platform. All the teams did well and more importantly everyone had fun.</p>

Campbell and I cannot wait and are already planning several new, fun, energetic, and engaging sessions!</p>
