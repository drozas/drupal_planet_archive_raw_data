<p><img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/9963614865_0e7fd208ed_m.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 2em 2em;" />We have a great tradition of extended sprints around big Drupal events including DrupalCons and Drupal Dev Days. While there is a sprint day included in DrupalCons (usually) on the last day of the con, given that a lot of the Drupal core and contrib developers fly in for these events, it makes a lot of sense to use this opportunity to start sooner and/or extend our stay and work together in one space on the harder problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://latinamerica2015.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Latin America in Bogotá</a> is the next DrupalCon! We are still looking for space and additional sponsors for the sprints before/after to help with space, internet, coffee, tea and maybe food. There are already various sprints signed up including <em>Multilingual and Sign me up for anything</em>. We are really friendly and need all kinds of expertise!</p>
<p><strong>Now is the time to consider if you can be available and book your travel and hotel accordingly!</strong></p>

<h3 class="content">Frequently asked questions</h3>
<h4>What is a sprint?</h4>
<p>Drupal sprints are opportunities to join existing teams and further Drupal the software, our processes, drupal.org and so on.</p>
<h4>Do I need to be a pro developer?</h4>
<p>No, not at all. First of all sprints include groups working on user experience, designs, frontend guidelines, drupal.org software setup, testing improvements, figuring out policies, etc. However you can be more productive at most sprints if you have a laptop.</p>
<h4>Why are there 6 consecutive days of sprints?</h4>
<p>DrupalCon is the time when most people in the Drupal community get together. We try to use this time to share our knowledge as well as further the platform in all possible ways. Therefore there is almost always an opportunity and a place to participate in moving Drupal forward.</p>
<h4>What if I'm new to Drupal and/or sprinting, how can I join?</h4>
<p>If you feel new and would love helping hands, the best day to start is the Thursday Feb 12 sprint day. This is the biggest sprint day with lots of people sprinting and different opportunities based on experience level. For a guided introduction to the tools and processes we use to collaborate, go to the First Time Sprinter workshop in the morning. If you know the tools but still could use help picking issues and going through the process, the Mentored Core Sprint is for you.</p>
<h4>I worked on Drupal before, which sprints are for me?</h4>
<p>If you have experience with Drupal issues and maybe already know a team/topic, any days of a DrupalCon may be your sprint days, and even the days before and after. These sprints do not have formal mentoring available, but of course if you have questions, there are always plenty of friendly people to help you. The community organizes off-site sprint opportunities for the days before/after DrupalCon and the event itself provides sprint locations from Feb 10 -12 throughout the session days in the event venue and in the official event hotel. These sprints are broken down to teams working on different topics. It is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtDYnjV5l0uydEVCVTRjYzhkXzF6N05WelRrZlAxNnc#gid=0">very important that you sign up for them</a>, so we know what capacity to plan with.</p>
