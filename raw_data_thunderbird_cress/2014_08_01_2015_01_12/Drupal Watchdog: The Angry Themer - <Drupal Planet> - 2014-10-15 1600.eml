              <p>Welcome back to the ANGRY THEMER!</p>
<p>Faithful readers of this column who have followed my outbursts over the past few years might ask, “How can I prevent myself from turning into a grumpy old themer with high blood pressure like you?”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Drupal project has grown to include new tools to help battle-hardened Vikings such as I cope with Drupal’s terrible markup and keep my rage more or less under control. </p>
<p>And you, dear themer, no longer have to dive into code or understand the inner workings of Drupal, while also battling Responsive, Web 2.0, Internet Explorer versions 6,7, 8, 9..., Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Opera – not to mention the gazillion tablets and smartphones. (Ah, but that’s another story, best saved for another day.)</p>
<p>These are my favorite weapons – uh, I mean tools, tools of the trade – that I utilize when I need to slice through the Drupal Markup sludge.</p>
<h3>Themes</h3>
<p>Drupal contrib has a ton of “Starter Themes”; so you don't have to trudge through all the basics every time you design a site. </p>
<p>Of course my favorite theme is the Mothership (Full Disclosure: written by your very own Angry Themer), which isn’t so much a theme as a complete cleanup of Drupal’s approach to markup.</p>
<h4>Mothership – Keelhaul the DIV!</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/mothership">Mothership theme</a> is not something you use to make your site pretty; this isn’t Wordpress. It’s designed to make your source code look and act  awesome by knifing through the sea of divs, classes, and about 20% of old markup fixes that come packed with Drupal, and deep-sixing it – leaving sparkling-clean HTML5 in its wake. </p>
<p>The Mothership theme comes equipped to clean up nearly every dusty corner and musty absess of Drupal that needs cleaning up:</p>
<ul><li>settings for removing class names</li>
<li>corrects the markup to HTML5 standards</li>
<li>modifies CSS &amp; Javascript files</li>
</ul><p>It also comes with commonly used basic CSS and JS libraries to help with responsive HTML5 sites, and now it even fixes the IE 9 CSS caching/respond.js issue.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you get to swagger and swear like a Caribbean pirate – and the ship’s captain strongly resembles Johnny Depp! </p>
<p>For those less-aggressive themers out there (and you know who your are), maybe Zen or Aurora – which have a more relaxed attitude towards markup – are more your speed. </p>        </div>
