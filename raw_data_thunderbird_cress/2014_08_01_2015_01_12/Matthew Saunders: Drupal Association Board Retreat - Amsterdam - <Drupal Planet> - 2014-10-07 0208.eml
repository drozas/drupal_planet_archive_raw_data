I've poured over financials, talked through plans for expansion and diversification of the organization.  I've been working with the Governance Committee and have taken on the role of Committee Chair.  I'm a bit of policy wonk, having been heavily involved in policy in the Charter School and Arts Nonprofit/State Government world.  </p>
<p>During our most recent retreat in Amsterdam, the board broke up into their committees and started sorting out what we want to accomplish for the year.</p>
<p>I'll be working with the Governance Committee to achieve a few goals.</p>
