However, this isn’t a one-man show; we need your help. There are many ways to get involved such as <a href="http://2014.bluedropawards.org/volunteer">volunteering</a>, becoming a <a href="http://2014.bluedropawards.org/sponsor">sponsor</a>, posting to your social media networks and more.</p>
<p>In case you were not aware, in 2012, a group of volunteers set out to create an annual program that aims to increase the awareness of Drupal and it’s capabilities. Now in it’s fourth year, this community-nominated, publicly-voted event recognizes the contributions of individuals, companies, and projects. The Blue Drop Awards are 100% volunteer-organized so we need your help to highlight and showcase the best Drupal websites/modules out there.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways of getting involved! Currently we're looking for sponsors to help us continue this annual project and volunteers to help us run the project. </p>
<p>We're looking for kind <a href="volunteer">volunteer</a><a href="http://volunteer">s</a>, who are interested in helping with verifying nominations, web design, development, running the booth at DrupalCon LA, wrangling other volunteers and sponsors, and more.</p>
<p>Sponsors are the only way for us to make this a sustaining project because it takes significant amounts of time and resources to put this project on every year. Luckily for our fantastic sponsors, there are tons of <a href="sponsor">benefits of becoming a sponsor</a>! For 2015 we have four sponsorship packages to choose from; sign up and we’ll get your brand in front of tens of thousands of people in the Drupal community. This is a great lead generation and branding opportunity for our sponsors.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you decide to sponsor or volunteer, we can't wait to see all of the great Drupal nominees come February!</p>
