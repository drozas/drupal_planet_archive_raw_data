Welcome to the fifth redesign of sooperthemes.com!<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LunbLP9.jpg" /></p>
<h2>What's new at SooperThemes</h2>
<p>The fifth major update to sooperthemes.com is the biggest update ever. It's a completely new site, unlike the previous sites which were built on top of the original alldrupalthemes.com (2007!)! </p>
<p>The new site comes with a big shift in focus. With Drupal 7 sites becoming more complex, and the upcoming Drupal 8 introducing new power and flexibility, but also complexity, we work hard to offer tools, services and products that allow everyone to profit form Drupal's flexibility without having to suffer the steep learning curve (alone). In addition to selling Drupal themes with turn-key demo sites we now offer more services:</p>
<ul><li>Custom built ticket system on sooperthemes.com, to work alongside e-mail support</li>
<li>Design to Drupal service, for affordable and top quality Drupal themes based on your own design</li>
<li>Enterprise Drupal services, including art direction, design, theming, data driven design and consulting.</li>
<li>No more one-off theme sales, total focus on club membership and long term support</li>
</ul><p>Our new tools are the best part, read on to learn about our major plans to support Drupal for small/medium businesses.</p>
<h2>Drupal Developers will Love these New Tools:</h2>
<h3>A new Distribution: Drupal CMS Powerstart</h3>
<p>Drupal's awesome architecture is what makes it such an awesome alternative to competing CMS like Wordpress and Joomla, but setting up shop with Drupal is described by many as painful and too complicated. Here, Drupal's power in flexibility is also it's weakness. It takes too much time to install basic features like WYSIWYG with media management: you need to find modules and set up complicated configurations, sometimes needing patches or development versions of modules, external libraries, etc.<br />
To solve this problem, we created a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cms">Drupal CMS</a> Distribution, targeted to small business sites and aiming to make life easier for developers and shops who create small sites.</p>
<h3>Drupal CMS Powerstart needs beta testers: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cms">https://www.drupal.org/project/cms</a></h3>
<p>Dries has mentioned in several keynotes that Distributions are the key to make Drupal more accessible and therefore the Drupal ecosystem more succesful. We too believe distributions are the solution but we don't like how they are currently made and how they are managed by drupal.org. Therefore we have created a new interface: A user-friendly interface to our distribution that lets you pick features, so that you don't get a bulky distro with everything in it, and the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Check out the custom build interface to Drupal CMS Powerstart: </p>

<h2>Twitter Bootstrap Fans will love what we did with Bootstrap 3</h2>
<p>In order to create a truly responsive distribution, we developed and refined a lot Bootstrap 3 Drupal-integration. Responsive grid control from Views, content organisation with Bootstrap shortcodes: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/bs_shortcodes">https://www.drupal.org/project/bs_shortcodes</a> and all our features come with default layouts that regardless of whether you use a Bootstrap theme.  </p>
<p>Development of Drupal CMS Powerstart is sponsored by sooperthemes.com and if you want to support future development of this new platform, please help beta testing and/or consider becoming a member of our premium themes club, you can see our "premium themed" version of CMS Powerstart here: <a href="http://glazed-demo.sooperthemes.com/">http://glazed-demo.sooperthemes.com/</a> - more <a href="http://www.sooperthemes.com/">Drupal themes</a>.</p>
