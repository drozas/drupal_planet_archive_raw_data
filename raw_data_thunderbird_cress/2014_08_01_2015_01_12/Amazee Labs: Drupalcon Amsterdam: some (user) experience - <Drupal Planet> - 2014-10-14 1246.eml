However, UX topics and raised questions are definitely worth mentioning.</span></span></p></div>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b04094cd-eaba-564f-1bbc-6eb878037307"><span>One of the most frequent UX topics of last year was better user experience crafted for the end-users of a website together with the importance of user research as a business objective. Knowledge of how and why people use a product conveys better understanding where the areas of improvements that need immediate mitigation are. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b04094cd-eac2-157f-8938-4205d58d27d2"><span>Last week, voices were raised to provide a clear statement that the new and shiny Drupal 8 and the further development of Drupal on both core and contrib levels, needs to get UX research and design involved. Some actions were taken during the last year. However, there is definitely more potential. In her <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/engaging-ux-and-design-contributors">talk "</a></span></span><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/engaging-ux-and-design-contributors">Engaging UX and Design Contributors"</a>,<span><span> </span></span><span id="docs-internal-guid-b04094cd-eac2-d8cd-3b20-1f6131db3de6"><span>Dani Nordin makes it clear. </span></span><span id="docs-internal-guid-b04094cd-eac9-a0c9-c57d-6f08588118c3"><span>All people who contribute to Drupal have a common goal to create a better, highly scalable and stable version of our content management system. And to do so, UX researches, designers and developers are bound to work closely together, listen to each other and actually apply results of user research. </span></span>To make this happen, we have to take action within the Drupal community. For example, UX researches and designers should be more involved in the development processes and procedures. Sometimes, designers and UX professionals are treated, as if their contribution is not important, which leads to a decrease of their motivation to spend their spare time for the community. Raising this topic lead to a lot of discussions. This resulted in the UX sprint producing a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/445028">list of goals </a>and directions that the community should go for in 2014 &amp; 2015.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b04094cd-ead1-6d33-5d3a-7c20d4021e4e"><strong>It’s about interaction.</strong></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b04094cd-ead5-3274-ef3e-9b9aa4ee0edf"><span>More and more discussions within the community were devoted to interaction design. The word “design” has a rather broad definition and can be understood differently. For example, “design” for the majority of people only means visual design or visual representation of the object.  UX researches and designers differentiate the visual and interaction design. The latter is about the workflows or concrete steps that users should perform to achieve the goal. No doubt, visual design is crucial for making people want to start an interaction with an object in the first place. However, the quality of interactions is the key for the product’s success. The best way to determine a user-friendly interaction is to actually attempt to accomplish a task, find the obstacles, redefine the workflow and test again before the implementation even starts. The best way to do so is prototyping. No matter how you create your prototypes, you can use HTML, as Roy Scholten suggests in his talk <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/because-its-about-interactions-better-ux-through-prototyping">“Because</a></span><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/because-its-about-interactions-better-ux-through-prototyping"><span> </span><span>it's about the interactions. (Better UX through prototyping)”</span></a></span>, or a broad palette of other tools that do not require advanced programming skills. The most crucial point is to prove that interactions really work and they do so for real users.  </p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b04094cd-ead9-191c-9c80-11baac791dd7"><strong>Don’t prototype in Drupal!</strong></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">The topic of the importance of prototyping gained further attention in the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/axure-prototyping-drupal">presentation</a> of Dani Nordin. Don’t prototype in Drupal is a strong statement, and it has a point. One of the most popular prototyping tools Axure can help with the design at different levels: high and low fidelity. Creating Axure-based prototypes is faster and cheaper than spending days or weeks on Drupal site building and coding. Prototypes allow, however, to ensure the directions of a project, make it possible to talk with stakeholders about tangible and interactive product before applying the development forces and, again, it’s the way to receive the user feedback. This insighs can be applied not only to the products built in Drupal, but to Drupal itself. This will improve not only the life of content creators, but can help developing more elegant solutions using the better design features of the Drupal core together with contrib modules. </p>
