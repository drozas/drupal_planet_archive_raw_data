    <div class="field field-node--body field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden" data-edit-id="node/24/body/und/rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>I doubt that many people who read this will be unaware of the extremely severe security vulnerability that was discovered reported and patched a couple of weeks ago or the later realease and many related blog posts pointing out <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005" target="_blank">exactly how critical early updates and patching are</a>. </p>

<p>If this has ruined a little of your free time recently and/or entailed your agency really earning the costs of any maintenance contracts you offer consider how <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29846539" target="_blank">terrifying some of the press and implications </a>are for owners of unsupported Drupal sites many of whom will be small charities and local organisations.</p>

<p>I would like to think that local Drupal groups etc. and the 'Drupal community' in general would step up and help out, if enough of us do that then we could generate some positive press. Yes we have a security team etc that is good, but how are we going to help out?</p>

<p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/drupalbristol" target="_blank">local Drupal group</a> will attempt to answer questions and find people to provide a little support (anybody else??), </p>

<p>Appreciate that many people are not in the position to provide a lot of effort for free, even a small amount of advice could get people on the right track and Drupal groups are likely to know good freelancers that can afford to help a small company for considerably less than typical agency fees. </p>

<p>All those hackthons, sprints, efforts to drive D8 forward, anybody brave enough to divert some of that effort towards auditing/fixing local sites?? I hope so.</p>

<p>BTW I have slight doubts about this site although I did fix by hand <a href="http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/commit/?id=19b32a3" target="_blank">based on this commit</a> (this is an old alpha). I will be trashing this server shortly and migrating to a new Beta 2 site and fresh server. </p>
