    <p>My DrupalCon Amsterdam Core Conversation on <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/managing-complexity">Managing Complexity</a> has generated quite a bit of follow-up discussion.  That's good; it's a conversation we as a community really need to be having.</p>
<p>There are a few points, though, that I feel bear clarification and further explanation as I fear the point of the talk has gotten lost in the details.</p>
<p>Before continuing, if you haven't yet I urge you to watch the session video as well as the background resources linked from the session page.  This is not a new conversation; it's the latest chapter in a very long-running discussion that is larger than the Drupal project, and it behooves us all to be aware of the history and context around it.</p>
