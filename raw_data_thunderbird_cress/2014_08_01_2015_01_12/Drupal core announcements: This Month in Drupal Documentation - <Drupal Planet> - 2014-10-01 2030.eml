    <title>Drupal core announcements: This Month in Drupal Documentation</title>

    <p>Here's an update from the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">Documentation Working Group (DocWG)</a> on what has been happening in Drupal Documentation in the last month or so. Sorry... because this is posted in the Core group as well as Documentation, comments are disabled.</p>
<p>If you have comments or suggestions, please see the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">DocWG home page</a> for how to contact us. Thanks!</p>
<h3>Notable Documentation Updates</h3>
<p>Here are some Community Documentation pages that were updated this past month:</p>
<ul>
<li>ruscoe updated several pages of documentation about the Drupal Commerce IATS module. We always love to see contributed module maintainers documenting their modules -- thanks Dan!</li>
<li>andrisek updated several pages of documentation about the ERPAL CRM system contributed module. In this case, he's not even an official maintainer of the project -- we always love to see community members updating documentation too -- thanks Daniel!</li>
<li>chrischinchilla went through the Installation Guide and made updates for Drupal 8. That was one of our "Priority" tasks -- thanks Chris!</li>
<li>Many people updated documentation in preparation for code sprints in Amsterdam, to help new contributors get up to speed quickly. Always a good idea!</li>
<li>And there were many more updates... see below.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">DocWG home page</a> for how to contact us, if you'd like to be listed here in our next post!</p>
<h3>Thanks for contributing!</h3>
<p>Since September 1 (<a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/440528">our previous TMIDD post</a>), 229 contributors have made 629 total Drupal.org documentation page revisions, including 2 people that made more than 20 edits (andrisek and realityloop) -- thanks everyone!</p>
<p>In addition, there were many many commits to Drupal Core and contributed projects that improved documentation -- these are hard to count, because many commits combine code and documentation -- but they are greatly appreciated too!</p>
<h3>Documentation Priorities</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/priorities">Current documentation priorities page</a> is always a good place to look to figure out what to work on, and has been updated recently.</p>
<p>If you're new to contributing to documentation, these projects may seem a bit overwhelming -- so why not try out a <a href="https://drupal.org/contributor-tasks/writers">New contributor task</a> to get started?</p>
<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
<p><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org" title="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org">https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org</a> - DrupalCon Amsterdam - <strong>THIS FRIDAY, October 3 - sprint!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bogota2015.drupal.org/" title="http://bogota2015.drupal.org/">http://bogota2015.drupal.org/</a> - DrupalCon Latin America, Bogot√°, Columbia, Feb 10-12, 2015</p>
<h3>Report from the Working Group</h3>
<p>We're pleased to announce that Antje Lorch (ifrik) has officially joined the Documentation Working Group. She's been a leader of documentation events and has been participating in WG meetings for a while, so it's great to have her officially on board. Welcome Antje!</p>
<p>In our last This Month post, we forgot to report on a couple of our "infrastructure and tools" projects that were completed in August:</p>
<ul>
<li>We updated the Documentation Management page (log in to see it): <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/manage" title="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/manage">https://www.drupal.org/documentation/manage</a> -- it is wider and has improved columns and filters. Use it to find a page you want to work on!</li>
<li>We updated the tab navigation for the Community Documentation pages: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation" title="https://www.drupal.org/documentation">https://www.drupal.org/documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We're currently working on a new project: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2191343">integrating api.drupal.org results into the Drupal.org search box</a> -- stay tuned for updates on that!</p>
<p>Finally, our next meeting will be October 22nd. We normally meet using Google Hangouts (although last month we met in IRC due to technical difficulties); if you'd like to join us, <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/user/6005">contact Boris (batigolix)</a>.</p>
