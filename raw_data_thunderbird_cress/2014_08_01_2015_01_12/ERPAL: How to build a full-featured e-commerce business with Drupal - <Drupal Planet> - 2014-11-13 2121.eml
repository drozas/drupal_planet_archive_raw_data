It provides flexible modules for building e-commerce features and for defining workflows, data structures and lists, and displays. The Drupal Commerce framework provides you with everything required to sell products, services or files online. It integrates very well with Drupal and all its contrib modules, so you almost only need to do configuration – no programming – to build the features you need. In ERPAL Platform, we’ve built a Drupal distribution for the community to use to create flexible business applications. To be as adaptable as possible, it’s based on Drupal Commerce, CRM Core and ERPAL Core. So ERPAL Platform itself actually just supplies an appropriate collection of "best practice" modules from the Drupal community that are already preconfigured and cleverly fitted together to provide features for all kinds of business processes. The sales process is therefore already preconfigured and you can extend it as necessary to integrate seamlessly with project management features, manufacturing features or online shop features.</p>
<p>In the video below, we show you how you can implement ERPAL Platform to use its existing features as the administration backend of your online shop and add a storefront where your customers can buy your products, request quotations and place orders. This enables you to build a complete online business "in one Drupal box" including a backend with a lightweight CRM as well as quotations, orders and invoices to cover the entire sales process for an e-commerce business. In this example your online store will have a completely different theme compared to the administration backend. All you need to do is to download some additional modules and add some specific configurations. It’s that easy: just watch the video!</p>
