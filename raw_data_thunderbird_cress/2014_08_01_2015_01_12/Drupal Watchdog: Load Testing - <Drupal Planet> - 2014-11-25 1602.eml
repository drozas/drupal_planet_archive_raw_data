While critical to the launch process of any project, load testing is also useful to integrate into your standard testing procedure. It can help you locate bottlenecks and generic performance regressions introduced in the evolution of a site post launch (due to code and infrastructure changes).</p>
<p>There are many different methodologies and applications for performing load tests, but generally it involves bombarding various pages on the site with enough traffic to start causing degradation. From there, work can be done to isolate bottlenecks in order to improve performance. By performing periodic load tests, you are much more likely to catch something while itâ€™s still a minor performance issue, not after it becomes a major problem.</p>
<h3>Different Types of Load Tests</h3>
<p>There are a number of different load testing configurations (sometimes referred to as <em>test plans</em>) which can be used individually or in conjunction to provide insight into site performance. Generally, we end up running three different types of tests:</p>        </div>
