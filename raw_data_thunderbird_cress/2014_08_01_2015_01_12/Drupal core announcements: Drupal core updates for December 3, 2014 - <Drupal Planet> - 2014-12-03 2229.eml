    <h2>What's new with Drupal 8?</h2>
<ul>
<li>@alexpott premiered <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/config_installer">Config installer</a> an install profile that takes over the Drupal installer and allows sites to be created from existing configuration. This opens the door for some interesting possibilities moving forward.</li>
<li>We upgraded Drupal core to use Symfony 2.6 stable. Symfony 2.6 includes over 100 new features and enhancements. For full details see <a href="http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-6-0-released">the release announcement</a>.</li>
<li>Following on from <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-006">SA-CORE-2006</a> we removed mixed SSL support from core, focusing on security by default.</li>
<li>We updated CKEditor library to 4.4.6, which included an important security fix. This also brought two new features, see <a href="http://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-4.4.6-Released">the release announcement</a> for more detail.</li>
<li>We fixed a number of performance issues including <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2384163">Entity render cache is needlessly cleared when an Entity*Form*Display is modified</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2378095">Convert all remaining attached individual CSS/JS assets to attached asset libraries</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2377397">Themes should use libraries, not individual stylesheets</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2368275">EntityRouteEnhancer and ContentFormControllerSubscriber implicitly depend on too many services</a>.</li>
<li>We are working to explain the configuration structures properly with configuration schemas. Recent big changes include all test views being validated and fixing user, system, link, etc. modules. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2183983">There is still a long way to go, follow and join the efforts</a>.</li>
<li>We resolved a number of security issues including resolving the last missing default access for entity fields, the last one being taxonomy terms. We also made sure that twig debug output can't be used as an XSS vector.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where's Drupal 8 at in terms of release?</h2>
<p>Since the last Drupal Core Updates, we fixed 18 critical issues and 12 major issues, and opened 9 criticals and 18 majors. That puts us overall at <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">110 release-blocking critical issues</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=15&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=300&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">705 major issues</a>.</p>
<p>Part of managing Drupal 8 toward its release is continuously reassessing what <em>must</em> block a release of 8.0.0. (Remember, hundreds of thousands of people will benefit from <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0">all the great new functionality in Drupal 8</a>, so we need to be smart about what does or doesn't hold up that release!) The chart below illustrates not only those newly discovered and newly fixed critical issues each week, but also issues that are <em>promoted to</em> critical and <em>demoted from</em> critical based on our latest understanding. For more information on what is (and isn't) release-blocking, see the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/issue-priority">handbook page on issue priority</a>.</p>

<h2>Current focus</h2>
<p>The current top priority in Drupal 8 is to resolve issues that block a beta-to-beta upgrade path (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;version%5B%5D=8.0.x-dev&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=D8+upgrade+path">critical issues tagged 'D8 upgrade path'</a>). We also need core contributors to continue <a href="https://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks/update-allowed-beta">evaluating issues for the beta phase</a> based on the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/beta-changes">beta changes policy</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, keep an eye out for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.0.x-dev&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=blocker">critical issues that are blocking other work</a>.
