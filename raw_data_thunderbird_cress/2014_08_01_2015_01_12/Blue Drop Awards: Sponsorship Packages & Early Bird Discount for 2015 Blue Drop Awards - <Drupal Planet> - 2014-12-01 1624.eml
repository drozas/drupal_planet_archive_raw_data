We’re extremely excited about the direction of the project but we believe, with your help, the Blue Drop Awards can be bigger and better. </p>
<p> This past year we’ve received nearly 60,000 visitors to the Blue Drop Awards website which represents a 28% increase over 2013 and a 46% increase over 2012. For the coming year, we’re aiming to receive over 100,000 visitors to the Blue Drop Awards. </p>
<p> Over the last few weeks, we’ve been working to determine the best possible sponsorship packages for 2015. While you may sign up for a sponsorship package at any time, we’re offering a<strong> 20% discount for all 2015 sponsors who sign up before 12pm CST on January 23, 2015.</strong></p>
<p>I’ll take a moment to highlight some of the changes; for a detailed decription, check out our <a href="http://bluedropawards.org/sponsor">Sponsorship page</a>. For 2015 we have four different types of sponsorship packages. </p>
<p> <strong>The Freelance - $500:</strong></p>
<ul><li>At $500 this package is meant for freelancers who are one to two man shops. The ultimate value here is that your brand will be in front of 100,000 people in 2015. We will display your logo in the right side bar on every page on the website. After 2015, the website is archived, but still accessible. Even today, 2012.bluedropawards.org still receives a significant amount of traffic everyday meaning continued exposure for a one-time $500 investment. You’ll also be recognized as a sponsor at the awards presentation at Drupalcon LA. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Silver - $2,000:</strong></p>
<ul><li>One step up from Freelance. This package is specifically meant for emerging companies. In addition to having your logo displayed on every page of the 2015 Blue Drop Awards website, we have added some additional advertising at Drupalcon LA. Your logo and booth number will be displayed at the Blue Drop Awards booth. Additionally, we will link to your website within the winners announcement email blast to provide additional traffic opportunities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Gold - $3,000:</strong></p>
<ul><li>In addition to having your logo on the right sidebar of the Blue Drop Awards’ website, you will also have your own branded and customizable landing page complete with a contact form with the gold package. Your company will have the ability to log into the Blue Drop Awards website to edit your page. We will include your logo on the 2015 Blue Drop Awards t-shirts and on the winner awards. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Platinum - $3,500:</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Platinum package is for companies who want to take full advantage of the lead generation opportunities available through the Blue Drop Awards. As with all packages, your logo will be included on all webpages. You will have your own customizable landing page, but in addition to having your logo, contact form and a description of the company, you will also be able to advertise downloadable content and current job openings. When someone downloads your content, we will notify you and give you their contact information. For a direct marketing approach, we’ll send out a sponsored email blast to the Blue Drop Awards subscriber list. To top it off, you will also be mentioned in tweets, blogs, case studies, and more. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
