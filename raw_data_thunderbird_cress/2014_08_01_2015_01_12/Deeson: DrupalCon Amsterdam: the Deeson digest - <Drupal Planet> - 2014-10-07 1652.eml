    <p>Last week was all about <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Amsterdam</a>.</p>
<p>Deeson’s MD, Tim Deeson, sat on a <a href="https://www.deeson.co.uk/blog/deesons-drupalcon-session-life-fast-lane-achieving-sustainable-growth">panel Q&amp;A</a>, I rallied the community with <a href="https://www.deeson.co.uk/blog/take-look-our-swag-drupalcon-amsterdam">giveaways and things to play with</a> and our Solutions Architect John Ennew joined in <a href="https://www.deeson.co.uk/labs/drupalcon-amsterdam-phase2-hackathon-drupal-distributions">hackathons</a>. We also organised Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more, here is our complete guide to Europe’s biggest Drupal conference event which celebrates the community and experiences working with Drupal’s open source software.</p>
        
    
  



  
    
        
          <h4>1. The keynotes</h4>
<p>The two main keynotes at the conference were delivered by Drupal founder, <a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries Buytaert</a>, and science fiction author, activist, journalist, blogger and co-editor of <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>, Cory Doctorow. They were very different in style and approach, but both were fascinating and highly informative.</p>
<p><strong>Dries Buytaert</strong></p>
<p>Dries’ keynote focused on the maturity of <strong>Drupal</strong> as a platform and community. He touched on the inevitable growing pains and the tough choices we all face as Drupal expands its reach and influence.</p>
<p>He drew on proven growth principles, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>, to illustrate Drupal’s ‘journey’. He highlighted how Drupal's reach can grow with community support, from local leadership initiatives to rewarding Drupal contributors.</p>

          <p><strong>Cory Doctorow</strong></p>
<p>Cory discussed the significance of free and open source software, highlighting the challenges and issues which impact us all.</p>
<p>As a tech evangelist, he shared his expert insight into the importance of software transparency in an age where tech and devices infringe on our everyday lives. It was pretty sobering.</p>
<p></p>
        
    
  



  
    
        
          <h4>2. Drupal 8: the beta release</h4>
<p>Dries announced the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0">beta release of Drupal 8</a>. The Drupal community will now be working together to find and fix bugs before the full release of Drupal 8. </p>
        
    
  



  
    
        
          <h4>3. The sessions</h4>
<p>Tim took part in a business-focused panel session entitled: 'Life in the fast lane - achieving sustainable growth'.</p>
<p>The hour-long session went through issues and challenges faced by Drupal agencies, shops and freelancers trying to achieve growth. Read the <a href="https://www.deeson.co.uk/blog/deesons-drupalcon-session-life-fast-lane-achieving-sustainable-growth">key takeaways here</a> or check out the video:</p>

          <h4>4. Mentoring</h4>
<p>John signed up as a sprint mentor for the first time and taught new contributors to Drupal Core how they can set up contributing tools. </p>
<p>Mentoring the Drupal community builds confidence and empowers developers to become regular contributors to Drupal Core.</p>
<p></p>
        
    
  



  
    
        
          <h4>5. Swag demand</h4>
<p>The event may focus on code but t-shirts feature heavily. </p>
<p>Our designer, Rachael Case, created a stunning Deeson DrupalCon tee which flew off our stand. They were so popular, people even nabbed the display tees off the wall!</p>

          <h4>6.Frame of Fame</h4>
<p>As you might understand by now, community is at the core of Drupal. </p>
<p>We wanted to celebrate the community who worked on Drupal 8 with our Frame of Fame. Check out the faces behind the code, contributes and commits…</p>

          <p>We took the Frame of Fame into the digital world with The Drupal8r...</p>
        
    
  



  
    
        
          <h4>7. The Drupal8r</h4>
<p>Our developer, Chris, created an amazing data visualisation tool, The Drupal8r shows who in the Drupal community developed Drupal 8 during the last 5000 commits. <a href="https://www.deeson.co.uk/drupal8r">Give it a whirl yourself! </a></p>

          <h4>8. The Dries interview</h4>
<p>It’s not everyday you get to interview the founder of Drupal, Dries Buytaert. But we did.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing our conversation with Dries soon, so sign up to our newsletter at the bottom of this page to find out about the successes and failures in Drupal 8 delivery. </p>
<p>We’ll also be publishing our #AskDries video where Dries answers questions from DrupalCon attendees. Watch this space!</p>
        
    
  



  
    
        
          <h4>9. The BoFs</h4>
<p>John and I ran BoFs at DrupalCon Amsterdam. John focused on experiences of integrating Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems with Drupal while I explored the need for personas in the site build process.</p>
