          <div property="content:encoded" class="field-item even"><p>In the summer of 2007, I received an email from Michael Skok of Northbridge Venture Partners, who I had known for 12 years at that time.   I had recently exited Mercury Interactive after its acquisition by HP.   He suggested that I meet with a entrepreneur around a project he was looking at.   When I met with Jay Batson, and short thereafter with Dries Buytaert, I was intrigued.   It was Michael's vision about the possibilities however that really grabbed my attention.   The three asked me later that year to join the yet unnamed company as its founding CEO.</p></div>
