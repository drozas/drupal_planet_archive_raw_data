    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>2 days ago there was an unsolicited email incident on Groups.drupal.org. A number of people were added to a group without their permission and subsequently received email notifications for posts and comments in that group. This was done via 'Add members' functionality, which was available to all group organizers on Groups.drupal.org. The problem was reported via <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/groupsdrupalorg">the Groups issue queue</a> and other channels and site maintainers took immediate steps to delete the group in question and disable comments on posts to stop email notifications going out to all affected users.</p>
<p>Our next step was to disable 'Add members' functionality to prevent such situations in the future. Group organizers still have 'Invite friend' functionality available to invite people to their groups, which will require users to accept invitation, giving their explicit permission to be added to the group.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience this caused.</p>
<p>Groups.drupal.org team</p>
