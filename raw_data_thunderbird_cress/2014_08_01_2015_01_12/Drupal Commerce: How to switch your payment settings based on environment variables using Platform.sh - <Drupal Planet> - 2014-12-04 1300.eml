<p>This is actually true for <strong>any third-party service integration which provides a sandbox</strong> where you can test. The objective is to make sure you never send test data on a live account, no matter the service you're testing on.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, I will focus on payment method settings, but the principle remains the same for any other third-party integration. </p>
<p>I will start from an empty Drupal site hosted on <a href="https://platform.sh">Platform.sh</a> and go through the following steps:</p>
<ul><li>Enable and configure <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_paypal">Paypal WPS</a> payment method</li>
<li>Export its configuration to a <em>settings.local.php</em> file</li>
<li>Override its <strong>Sandbox</strong> configuration on the Staging environment</li>
<li>Write custom code to read the configuration from the <em>settings.local.php</em></li>
</ul><p>As you see, the goal (<em>as always with Drupal</em>) is to read the configuration from your code so that you can easily switch from a sandbox mode to a live mode.</p>
