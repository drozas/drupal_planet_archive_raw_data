Some projects warrant a dev, qa, etc. as well, but for the purposes of this post, let's just assume you often run drush commands on local or development environments during development, and eventually run a similar command on production during a deployment.</p>
<p>What happens if, at some point, you are churning through some Drush commands, using aliases (e.g. <code>drush @site.local break-all-the-things</code> to break things for testing), and you accidentally enter <code>@site.prod</code> instead of <code>@site.local</code>? Or what if you were doing something potentially disastrous, like deleting a database table locally so you can test a module install file, using <code>drush sqlq</code> to run a query?</p></div></div></div>
