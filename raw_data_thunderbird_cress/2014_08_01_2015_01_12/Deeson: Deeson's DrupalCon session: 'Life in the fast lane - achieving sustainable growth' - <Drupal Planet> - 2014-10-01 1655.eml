          <p>With questions from the packed audience and Twitter, there were plenty of interesting discussion points.</p>
<p>Here are our <strong>topline takeaways:</strong></p>
<h4>1. Why grow for the company?</h4>
<p>There are many reasons to grow, but the key one is to <strong>deliver success</strong>.</p>
<p>But, equally, you need to be sure you <em>want</em> to grow. What's more, there are different kinds of growth: <strong>acquisition</strong> and <strong>organic </strong>growth are the two most obvious. But they come with additional risks. Acquisition can prove very disruptive internally and externally with huge organisational shifts that can reverberate for a long time. Organic growth, while more steady, may enable you to optimise but can take a long time with the potential to put a company into a rut while things shift faster around you.</p>
<h4>2. Why grow for clients?</h4>
<p>The main reason is is to deliver a <strong>broad range of services</strong>. Why? Because if your clients' businesses grow successfully, so will yours. There's a note of caution: you can hit a point of diminishing return, so as hard as it is, try to find your company's sweet spot. Also don't be an IT elephant. <strong>Be agile</strong>. This means be large enough to service your clients, but flexible enough to meet the changing demands of your clients' needs.</p>
<h4>3. How do you differentiate your business in the market?</h4>
<p>There are different approaches to this. One way could be to <strong>identify a defining moment</strong> which changed your business, for example, when you took on your first major client. Another is to <strong>highlight specialisms</strong> you have. Whatever your USPs might be, you must tailor them to the right market. Remember it's <strong>not always one size fits all</strong>.</p>
<h4>4. Can you plan growth, or can it just happen?</h4>
<p>There are a number of things that will help you grow, but you need to think about budgeting cycles, a defined growth path and a <strong>realistic recruitment strategy</strong>. Added into the mix are the basics such as making sure you <strong>know your products</strong>, and sell what you are good at. But before anything, <strong>carry out deal evaluation</strong>. Be good at turning down work that's not right for you. It takes nerves of steel, but you build credibility.</p>
<h4>5. How do you sustain growth?</h4>
<p>Be bold. Tell people where you're going and why - <strong>be open</strong>. You must show cultural leadership by reflecting your values and goals in<em> everything </em>you do. This way you <strong>lead from the front line</strong> each day, which is critical to maintain growth.</p>
<h4>6. What is a risk to growth?</h4>
<p>You can look at market influences, shifts in buying patterns and other such external challenges. If you start to lose your culture, then you also <strong>risk your growth</strong>. If your role as a leader becomes <strong>'just a job'</strong>, then the alarm bells should start ringing. And if you are failing, face them head-on. Failures are not expensive but <strong>hidden failures </strong>are.</p>
