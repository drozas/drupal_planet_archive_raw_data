<p>We received many requests to make an updated version of our Atrium Folders feature available for the latest version of <a href="http://openatrium.com">Open Atrium</a>, the excellent Drupal-based solution for Intranets developed by Phase2.</p>

<p><a href="http://oecd.org">OECD</a> sponsored the development of the new version as an open source project, in order to add a file management functionality to the <a href="https://innovationpolicyplatform.org/">Innovation Policy Platform</a> site that it manages together with the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>. Atrium Folders for Open Atrium 2 is thus now available to everybody.</p>

<h2>The usual features, a new way</h2>

<p>Open Atrium changed completely and so did Atrium Folders. There are many differences under the hood, with a complete code rewrite, but the familiar user experience is still there.</p>

<h3>Uploading and downloading files</h3>

<p>Creating folders and adding files to the folders is as easy as creating any other content in Open Atrium 2: it is enough to create "Files sections". When you are viewing a folder, specific buttons allow to create subfolders,  upload files and directly download any file.</p>

<h3>Access management</h3>

<p>The access management works like for other nodes in Open Atrium. Access to the folder can be restricted for both viewing and editing separately, and it can be determined at a folder level.</p>

<h3>Notifications</h3>

<p>The notification system of Open Atrium can also be used for folders. Users can be informed when new files are added, with the same interface used by other Open Atrium features.</p>

<h2>And much more</h2>

<h3>Media module support</h3>

<p>The files are attached with the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/media">Media</a> widget and it is thus possible to manage not only files, but everything Media supports, like for example YouTube videos or files attached to other content.</p>

<h3>Multiple uploads, with drag and drop support</h3>

<p>The multi-upload feature of Open Atrium 2 can also be used with Folders to upload several files at the same time. Drag and drop uploads are supported too.</p>

<h3>Download folder as ZIP file</h3>

<p>The download button for files exists also for folders and it allows to download a folder with its subfolders and all included files as a ZIP archive. This functionality is available as a submodule, bundled with Atrium Folders.</p>

<h3>File and folder revisions</h3>

<p>Atrium Folders supports history and revisions both for folders and files. You can view previous versions of a file and optionally restore an older version. This functionality is available as a submodule, bundled with Atrium Folders.</p>

<h2>Download, installation and support</h2>

<p>The Open Atrium Folders feature can be downloaded and installed like any other module.</p>

<p>It is available on drupal.org at <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/oa_folders/">https://www.drupal.org/project/oa_folders/</a></p>
