<p>I&#39;m Andy, a developer at Ixis and having just settled back in after my first DrupalCon I thought I&rsquo;d wrap up my thoughts after attending the annual European conference for the first time.</p>
<p>Initially - wow - DrupalCon is big! I&rsquo;ve only been to some smaller <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/">PHP conferences</a> so to see over 2000 people in one place was quite something. What struck me was how well it was organised - everything was on time with very few technical&nbsp;hiccups. I found the number of sessions quite overwhelming - there was so much to choose from, so having the videos of the sessions online with in an hour or so after it finished was really helpful. I&rsquo;m still ploughing through the ones I&rsquo;m interested in.</p><p><a href="http://www.ixis.co.uk/blog/first-time-drupalcon" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
