Oct. 23, starting at 6:30 p.m.; see even more info in this <a href="http://zerotodrupal.com/content/headless-drupal-angularjs-hackathon-st-louis">Zero to Drupal</a> post).</p>
<p>We'll be hacking away and seeing how far we can get, and hopefully we'll be able to leave with at least an MVP-quality product! I'll be at the event, mostly helping people get a Drupal 8 development environment up and running. For some, this alone will hopefully be a huge help, and maybe motivation to adopt Drupal 8 more quickly!</p>
<p>If you're in or around the St. Louis area, consider joining us; especially if you would like to learn something about either Drupal 8 or AngularJS!</p></div></div></div>
