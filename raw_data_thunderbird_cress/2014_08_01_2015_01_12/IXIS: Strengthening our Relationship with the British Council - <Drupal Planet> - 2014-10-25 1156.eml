<p>We are delighted to be working with the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/">British Council</a> on a new Drupal hosting and infrastructure support project. The British Council are valued clients, and we have worked with them for more than 6 years managing both the global suite of 150 country sites, and the prestigious suite of Drupal teaching and learning sites.</p>
<p>We will be working to to create four individual platforms for hosting key Drupal websites on, moving away from just one main infrastructure, to improve resilience, efficiency and increase availability to the sites which generate more than 35 million page impressions per month and are used by more than 65 million people each year alone.</p><p><a href="http://www.ixis.co.uk/blog/strengthening-our-relationship-british-council" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
