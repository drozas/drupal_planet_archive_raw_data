These tips that we&#8217;ll cover may be at times specific to Drupal 6 versions, although you can always learn the best practices from these examples and apply them on your own code base. <img class="alignleft" src="http://adamatomic.com/pics/blog/doom/doom2.jpg" alt="Doom" width="298" height="212" /> Doom skill  levels: (easiest first) 1.<strong> I&#8217;m too young to die</strong> 2. Hey, not too rough 3. Hurt me plenty 4. Ultra-violence 5. Nightmare! <strong>  This post is rated &#8220;I&#8217;m too young too die&#8221; difficulty level</strong>.   When we start out building <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal </a>websites, we gradually build functionality and a common use case is creating a view, then you might want to create some blocks, very much related to the view, so you create a block view using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views" target="_blank">Views </a>module. Then you maybe combine it with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/panels" target="_blank">Panels </a>or <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/context" target="_blank">Context</a>, it doesn&#8217;t really matter, but essentially you&#8217;ve been using the UI tools which are for ease of use, and the overhead for that lies in quite a bit of abstraction layer which later may cost in performance. Replacing the quicklinks and help and support blocks that were used in our theme&#8217;s sidebar from being a view based block to a simple programmatiaclly created block implementation proved to reduce a sizzling amount of ~200ms to ~2ms of server time spent on doing the same operation. That accounted for about ~200ms of page load time redduction for each page load, as this item was featured in many pages consistently on our theme.</p>
