<h2>What's new with Drupal 8?</h2>
<h3>DrupalCon Amsterdam and the Drupal 8 beta!</h3>
<p>It's been more than a month since the last Drupal Core Update, and so much has happened! Around 2300 people travelled to the historic city of Amsterdam, Netherlands for <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Amsterdam</a>, where after 5 days of sprinting, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2348025">Drupal 8.0 entered beta</a>! <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/448563">Beta 3</a> will be released on Wednesday, November 12.</p>

<p>Be sure to review the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/contribute/core/beta-changes">allowed beta changes policy</a> to understand which core issues are still priorities for Drupal 8.0, and which will need to wait for Drupal 8.1 or Drupal 9.</p>
<h3>Highly critical security fix released for Drupal 7 and 8</h3>
<p>On October 15th, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005">SA-CORE-2014-005, a highly critcial security fix necessary for all Drupal 7 and 8 sites was revealed</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.32-release-notes">Drupal 7.32</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2357303">Drupal 8.0.0-beta2</a> were released to address the issue. A week later, on October 29th, the Drupal security team issued <a href="https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003">a public service announcement</a> warning of automated attacks against Drupal sites that haven't been patched for SA-CORE-2014-005.</p>
<p>To help website administrators choose the best possible path for dealing with affected Drupal sites, Bevan Rudge has developed <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/blog/your-drupal-website-has-backdoor">a detailed flowchart</a> of actions to take, specific to different scenarios. One tool that can be useful is <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalgeddon">Drupalgeddon</a>, a Drush command that can help detect some of the exploits. It is important to understand that some attacks may not leave any trace. If possible, restore your Drupal site from backup made before October 15, 2014.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/10/a-lesson-in-security.html">A Lesson In Security</a>, Anthony Ferrara deconstructed the vulnerability and its resolution as well as Drupal Security Team's response. For some discussion of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/security-team">Drupal Security Team</a>'s practices and the media response, check out Bryan Ruby's post: <a href="http://bryanruby.com/drupal-security-not-shocking-responsible-1963">Drupal Security: Not Shocking but Responsible</a>.</p>
<h3>D8 critical office hours with chx</h3>
<p>Core contributor chx has started a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/446803">weekly critical issue office hours</a> on Fridays at 12:00p PST. If you are interested in really digging into a tough problem and helping resolve a stagnating release blocker, or if you are stuck on a critical currently, join <a href="http://www.drupal.org/irc">#drupal-contribute IRC channel</a> during the office hours. See <a href="http://www.drupal4hu.com/node/411">chx's report of the first critical office hours</a> for an idea of what we've done so far!</p>
<h2>Where's Drupal 8 at in terms of release?</h2>
<p>DrupalCon Amsterdam and the beta release have brought lots of new momentum to the critical issue queue, with many issues both identified and resolved. Of the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">130 critical issues currently blocking Drupal 8's release</a>, 1 in 3 are new since the initial beta release, and 58% have activity within the past two weeks!</p>

<h2>Where can I help?</h2>
<h3>Top criticals to hit this week</h3>
<p>Each week, we check with core maintainers and contributors for the "extra critical" criticals that are blocking other work. These issues are often tough problems with a long history. If you're familiar with the problem-space of one of these issues and have the time to dig in, help drive it forward by reviewing, improving, and testing its patch, and by making sure the issue's summary is up to date and any API changes are documented with a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/402688">draft change record</a>.</p>
