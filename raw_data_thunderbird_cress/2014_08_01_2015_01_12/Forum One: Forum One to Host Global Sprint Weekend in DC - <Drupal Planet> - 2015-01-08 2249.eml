<p>As part of a worldwide effort known as the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/447258">Drupal Global Sprint Weekend</a>, hundreds of coders from around the world are joining together in a united effort to complete a marathon task: the launch of the next generation of the world’s most popular open-source platform, Drupal 8.</p>
<p>To participate in this massive movement and contribute to the Drupal Community, Forum One is hosting a local Code Sprint in downtown Washington, DC on Saturday, January 17th. <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/washington-dc-drupal-code-sprint-weekend-tickets-15048474392">Sign up here »</a></p>
<p><strong>Never been to a code sprint before? No worries; we’re pros at these events! Here’s what you can expect:</strong></p>
<h2>What is a code sprint?</h2>
<p>A code sprint is when developers get together and write code. There&#8217;s minor instruction and some ad hoc mentoring, but mainly the focus is just uniting developers and hammering out code together. That&#8217;s all there is to it!</p>
<h2>How will this event work?</h2>
<p>Our developers will work with you to find Drupal 8 core issues for you to focus on. You won’t need to research anything on your own, but you will need to bring your own laptop, and it helps a lot if you set up your development environment beforehand. For instructions on how to get set up and for additional details like the event agenda, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/washington-dc-drupal-code-sprint-weekend-tickets-15048474392">visit the RSVP page »</a></p>
<h2>Why should I attend?</h2>

<li>You’ll meet other DC area developers!</li>
<li>You’ll roll up your sleeves and become a bona fide Drupal 8 Core Contributor!</li>
<li>You’ll learn from our on-site mentors and fellow developers!</li>
<li>You’ll earn tons of karma by furthering the mission of the open-source development model!</li>
<li>It’s totally free!</li>
</ul>
