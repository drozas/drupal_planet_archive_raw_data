<p>Nalini lives in a small city in India. To save money, all school books and student papers are copied or printed at the local print shop. Nalini is immensely annoyed with her classmates when they choose to print on a single side of paper. If everyone used both sides, she reasons, it would reduce their paper use by half. Nalini sends a message to Greenpeace International through Facebook: "I have an idea for a campaign you should run!" </p>
<p>Greenpeace International is an worldwide independent nonprofit organisation that aims to protect the environment and promote world peace. Originally founded in 1971, the organisation is now active in 44 countries and has 2.8 million supporters. With nearly 2 million Facebook likes and millions of site visitors worldwide, Greenpeace International receives suggestions like Nalini’s thousands of times per year, and because they simply can’t take on every new campaign idea, they wanted to find a way to empower its supporters to run their own campaigns, in their own communities.</p>
<p>In addition, Greenpeace International already had an active volunteer base of 20,000 volunteers, organised in about 400 local groups - each local group, or national volunteer network, had it’s own management and communication tools - a true global volunteering ‘database’ was non-existent, with the data instead spread across lots of individual spreadsheets and google-docs, making it hard to track and measure.</p>
<p>Challenges like these spurred Greenpeace International to create Greenpeace Greenwire, its own online community for employees and volunteers. It’s a meeting place where people can connect with other volunteers, activists and groups working on environmental campaigns in their country. When Greenpeace Greenwire rolls out to more offices, it will allow international connections too.</p>
<p>As well as helping activists find and participate in Greenpeace-led volunteer groups and events, Greenpeace Greenwire lets users create their own events and organize their own activities. Users can start groups, host events, run campaigns, share photos and videos, and write blogs.</p>
<p>Greenpeace Greenwire is a unique project in that it serves a worldwide community - so it needs to be able to scale up to hundreds of thousands of global users - but it also serves each element of that community’s specific set of needs. Flexibility is another key element of the project: allowing users to have different roles in different domains for national and regional offices, and also allowing for flexibility regarding which languages each user could choose. It was also crucial that each user feel comfortable providing their personal data in order to take full advantage of the Greenpeace Greenwire community, but on the other hand, the data must be kept secure and limited only to certain authorized users.</p>
