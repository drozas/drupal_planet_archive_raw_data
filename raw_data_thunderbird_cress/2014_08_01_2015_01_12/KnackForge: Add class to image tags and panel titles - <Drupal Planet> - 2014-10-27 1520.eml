It is very easy to apply responsive css to the web page by adding appropriate bootstrap classes. If you are new to the twitter bootstrap theme, see here <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">http://getbootstrap.com/css/</a> for more details about classes. Is it easy to add class to drupal site pages ? If yes, what to do to add class to panel title and image tags ? Lets come to the heart of the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Adding class to panel title</strong></p>
<p>      Eventhough it is easy to apply responsive css to the web page, when comes to drupal site we need to follow some standard approaches for adding classes. I need to add class to panel title in one of my requirements. By sticking with standard approach for this, I found this hook template_preprocess_panels_pane very useful to add class to panel title. Below code snippet will explain more detail about the usage.</p>
<pre class="brush: php; auto-links: true; collapse: false; first-line: 1; html-script: false; smart-tabs: true; tab-size: 4; toolbar: true; codetag">function themename_preprocess_panels_pane(&amp;$variables) {
  $variables['title_attributes_array']['class'][] = 'your class';
}  </pre><p>The above code snippet need to be written in theme's template.php file.</p>
<p><strong>Adding class to img tags</strong></p>
<p>      Then I need to add class to img tags to make the image responsive as one of my requirements. Similar to panel, I found this hook template_preprocess_image very useful to achieve this. See the below code snippet to know in detail</p></div></div></div>
