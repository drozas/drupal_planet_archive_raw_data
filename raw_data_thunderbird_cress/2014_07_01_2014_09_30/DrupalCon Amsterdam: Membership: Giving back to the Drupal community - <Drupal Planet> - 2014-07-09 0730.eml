Attending DrupalCon for the first time is always a game-changer for Drupal community members. It’s a chance to see the people behind the project, put names to faces, and build stronger connections in-person. You might even feel inspired to do more for the Drupal project thanks to the new friends you make at DrupalCon!</p>
<p>One easy way to do more for the community and the project is to add a Drupal Association Membership to your cart when you buy your Amsterdam ticket. We don’t bundle membership with your ticket because the Drupal community is built on the spirit of giving: our members to join us because they want to give back and push the project forward.</p>
<p>We make it easy to sign up and here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ul><li>Membership is annual for Individuals and Organizations</li>
<li>You can add membership to your ticket when you check out or buy it separately</li>
<li>You can renew an existing or lapsed membership here or on our <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/membership">membership page</a></li>
<li>You can buy memberships for your team. Just add a quantity of Individual Memberships and you’ll be contacted for the names to assign the memberships</li>
</ul><p>All Drupal Association members get special graphic on their conference badge, and will receive discounts on merchandise at the Drupal Association store at the convention. So don’t wait! Sign up to be a member today or when you register, or anytime before DrupalCon to get your Drupal Association member badge and to give back to the Drupal project.</p>
