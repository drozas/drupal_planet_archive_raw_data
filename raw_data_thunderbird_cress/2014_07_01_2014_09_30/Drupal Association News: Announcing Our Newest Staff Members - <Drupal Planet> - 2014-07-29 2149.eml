Please help us give a warm welcome to Oliver Davies, Archie Brentano, Phillip Bulebar, and Ryan Aslett!</p>
<p><img alt="Oliver Davies photo" class="left" src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/OliverDavies.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 74px;" />Oliver (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/opdavies">opdavies</a>) started with the Drupal Association in May of this year as a Drupal.org Developer. He has been active in the Drupal community for several years, has contributed numerous patches and modules, and prior to working with the Drupal Association, he contributed to the accessibility of the project. Since joining several months ago, Oliver has already made tremendous contributions to the Association and has seized the opportunity to give back to the community in any way he can.</p>
<p><img alt="Archie Brentano" class="left" src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/Archie-Brentano_0.png" style="width: 75px; height: 77px;" />Archie Brentano (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/isntall">isntall</a>) is the Association’s new DevOps Engineer. Previously, Archie worked as a Multnomah County System Administrator, focusing on enterprise Drupal sites on Amazon Web Services infrastructure. Archie will be concentrating on the infrastructure side of Drupal.org, and has joined the organization because he was impressed by the Drupal community and saw a perfect opportunity to learn more about Drupal and become better involved.</p>
<p><img alt="Phillip Bulebar photograph" class="left" src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/Photo%20on%207-28-14%20at%201.24%20PM.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 62px;" />Phillip Bulebar (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/pbulebar">pbulebar</a>) comes to the Drupal Association with a long and successful track record in marketing and web content management. As the Association’s new Content Manager, Phillip will be creating and optimizing content on Drupal.org to help ensure it meets the needs of visitors. Prior to joining the Association, Phillip held management roles for companies including Nike, Nautilus and other specialty retailers, with much of his focus on creating, delivering, analyzing and optimizing digital content.</p>
<p><img alt="Ryan Aslett photograph" class="left" src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/meinstagrammed.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" />Ryan Aslett (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mixologic">mixologic</a>) is joining the Drupal Association as the organization’s first QA Engineer. Previously, Ryan worked as a freelance full stack Drupal developer in the Portland, Oregon area; he has a wide variety of experience in everything from working with Perl to engineering composting toilets in Ecuador and Colombia. At the Association, Ryan will be improving BDD tests for Drupal.org websites, and we’re thrilled to welcome him on board.</p>
<p>Please help us give a warm welcome to our four newest staff members. We’re thrilled to have them on board and know they’ll do great things for the Drupal community.</p>
