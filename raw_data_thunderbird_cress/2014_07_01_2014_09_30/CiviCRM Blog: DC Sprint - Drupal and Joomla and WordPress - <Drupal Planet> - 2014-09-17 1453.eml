        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>I just returned from my first CiviCRM sprint. It was called the DC Sprint, but as Jeremy has already posted, we were actually in Maryland.</p>
<p>As a first time attendee of a CiviCRM conference and sprint, I really did not know what to expect. I was very pleased that both WordPress and Joomla! received some real attention at the sprint and I hope we are heading to a place where CiviCRM can be truly CMS agnostic.</p>
<p>WordPress CiviCRM installs can now benefit from WP-CLI tools. WP-CLI is a Drush equivilant for WordPress. We were able to merge Andy Walker's port into 4.5 and Tim Otten added full API Explorer support for this. At the developer training day in DC on Saturday, we noticed an issue with civix and WordPress. This also fixed and now civix works with all CMSs without having to be directly tied to one as in the past. These two enhancements will help WordPress developers immensely.</p>
<p>Dana Skallman and I also worked through the unresolved tickets for WordPress. A great deal of progress has been made there, and in addition to all the new features in 4.5 users will find that the WordPress integration is better than ever.</p>
<p>What really made the sprint a great event were the people. We had three CMSs represented and while there was some good natured kidding going on, it is clear to me that the community is focused on the CiviCRM project and supporting Drupal, Joomla! and WordPress.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to see the 4.5 release and I encourage everyone to participate in the CiviCRM Community. Whether you go to a meetup, Â attend CiviCon in the spring or go to the next Code Sprint, you will not be disappointed and the community will be the better for it.</p>
