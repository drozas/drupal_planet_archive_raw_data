    <h2>Defining moment</h2>

<p>A few months ago my DrupalCon Austin session was rejected. I was a bit upset, since presenting plays a big part in my trip to the states, and also surprised, as I mistakenly assumed my presentation repertoire would almost guarantee my session would be accepted. But the committee decided differently.</p>

<p>This has been an important moment for me. Two days later I told myself I don&#39;t care. I mean, I cared about the <em>presentation</em>, I just stopped caring that it was not selected, since I decided I was going to do it anyway. As an &quot;unplugged&quot; BoF.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/drupal-development-gizra-way">The Gizra Way</a>. I think this is probably the best presentation I&#39;ve given so far, and quite ironically my <em>rejected</em> session is second only to Dries&#39;s keynote in YouTube.</p>

<p>You see - I had a &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzm8kTIj_0M">there is no spoon</a>&quot; moment. The second I realized it can be done differently, I was on my own track, perhaps even setting the path for others.</p>
