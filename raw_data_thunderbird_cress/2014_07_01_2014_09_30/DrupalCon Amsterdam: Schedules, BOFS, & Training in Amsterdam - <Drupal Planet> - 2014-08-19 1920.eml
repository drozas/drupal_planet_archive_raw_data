You can start the hard work of choosing the sessions, BOFs, and social events you want to attend, and <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/schedule">build your own schedule</a> right on the DrupalCon Amsterdam site.</p>
<h3>BOF scheduling is live</h3>
<p>Speaking of <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/birds-of-a-feather">BOFs</a>, you don’t have to wait until DrupalCon Amsterdam to claim yours: you can start using the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/bofs/tuesday">online booking feature</a> today to schedule your BOFs. Be sure you do it soon, though— BOF rooms go fast!</p>
<h3>Register for training before 5 September</h3>
<p>Lastly, we need more people to <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/training">register to attend training</a> at DrupalCon Amsterdam. Show us you're interested in these topics! Book before <strong>5 September</strong> to make sure the course you want to attend runs. We know it's difficult to make a decision this early out, but classes which do not meet the minimum to run will be cancelled!</p>
<p><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/training">The training options are all fantastic</a> and a great opportunity to learn more about Drupal, so register today.</p>
<p>See you in Amsterdam!</p>
