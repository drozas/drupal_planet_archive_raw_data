<p>The excitement is clear. So what's next?</p><!--break-->

<h4>Put Your Code Where Your Mouth Is</h4>

<p>In any place where there's much excitement, there also tends to be a lot of discussion about what could or should be done. My suggestion is that we focus on creating real-world implementations with various JS frameworks and other API consuming clients.</p>

<p>To that end, I'm putting my code where my mouth is. Here's a <a href="http://dev-headless-drupal-8.gotpantheon.com/">working demo site</a>:</p>

<a href="https://dev-headless-drupal-8.gotpantheon.com/"><img src="https://www.getpantheon.com/sites/default/files/demo-site.png" alt="Headless Drupal Demo" />

<p>I've placed the rough demo code online <a href="https://github.com/joshkoenig/headless-drupal-angular">at GitHub</a>, so you can set up your own. Feel free to experiment with different implementations, or help out with the listed TODOs. Pull requests are welcome!</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>

<p>My ultimate vision is that we have a commonly accepted goal for demonstration implementations, and we find people who want to work on them for a number of popular JS MVC frameworks. It would also be interesting to have people do straight API implementations in raw Python or Ruby, or even just using Curl.</p>

<p>The end result would be something similar to <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a>, which helps people evaluate and embrace different JS frameworks. Having a repository of implementations would definitely speed up the process of attracting front-end developers to think about Drupal as a back-end for future projects.</p>

<p>At the same time, by focusing on practical/working implementations, we can much more effectively provide input and guidance to the continued core (and contrib) development. There's no need for Drupal engineers to build Headless in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates as we see the outcomes of the community response. Based on what I've seen online and at the SF DUG meetup, I think some really exciting energy will come out of this.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-blog-categories field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Blog Categories:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/blog/engineering">Engineering</a></div></div></div><div class="easy_social_box clearfix horizontal easy_social_lang_und">
