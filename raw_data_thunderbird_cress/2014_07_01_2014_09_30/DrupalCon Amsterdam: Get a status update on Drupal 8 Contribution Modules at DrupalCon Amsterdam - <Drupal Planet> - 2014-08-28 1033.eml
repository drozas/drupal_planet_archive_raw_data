As we all know, the real power in version upgrades lies in the contribution modules. Most of the maintainers are already working on their Drupal 8 ports, but what is their status?</p>
<p>While we would like to give every one of these maintainers their own full session to discuss their modules, they are unfortunately only so many slots available. Not to mention it would take a long time for you to attend all of these talks on top of the various other conference sessions!</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to update the community on the major modules, I have coordinated a double session where each maintainer will present their moduleâ€™s status. The presentations will be short and focused, freeing you up to enjoy other great conference content.</p>
<p>We will hear about the following modules:</p>
<ul><li>Webform (by quicksketch)
</li><li>Rules (by dasjo)
</li><li>Display Suite (by aspilicious)
</li><li>Media (by daveried/slashrsm)
</li><li>Search API (by drunken monkey)
</li><li>Commerce (by bojanz)
</li><li>Redirect, Global Redirect, Token, Pathauto (by berdir)
</li><li>Panels (by populist)
</li><li>Simplenews (by miro_dietiker/ifux)
</li></ul><p>The session will take place on Tuesday, September 30th from 14:15 - 16:45 (this is two session slots) in the Keynote Auditorium (Wunderkraut Room).</p>
<p><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/drupal-8-contrib-module-update" class="button-link">More information</a></p>
<p>Join us to learn directly from the maintainers what to expect of their Drupal 8 Modules!</p>
