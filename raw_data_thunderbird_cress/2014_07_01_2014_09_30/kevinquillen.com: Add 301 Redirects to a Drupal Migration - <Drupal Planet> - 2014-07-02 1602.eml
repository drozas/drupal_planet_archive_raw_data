    <p>Migrating content from one platform to another saves lots of time from doing grunt work and gets data moved fast. However, simply moving the content doesnâ€™t mean the job is done. There are other considerations too, such as 301
redirects for example. Since we are moving content, our aliases are likely changing too. We can create 301s while migrating content in all at once.</p>
