What's better, you can get involved making things happen and learn from those implementing the features firsthand. Here are my picks:</p>
<h3>Multilingual Drupal 8 site building and programming</h3>
<p><img src="http://hojtsy.hu/files/BerlageAmsterdam.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 2em 2em;" /></p>
<ul><li>There is no excuse to not <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/427578">attend some of the sprints</a> at and around DrupalCon. Sprints start two days ahead of the start of the conference on Saturday the week before. And there are still sprints going on the Sunday after the conference. It is not just the last day of DrupalCon itself where you can get involved and make a difference. In fact the leads are actually focusing more on the sprint on the weekend days. Also the weekend sprints are in a <em>really cool</em> venue. The best way to learn is to do!</li>
<li>You are looking for more of a directed guide of Drupal 8 still with the possibility to do it all hands-on? Look no further than <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/drupal-8-multilingual-hands">the Drupal 8 multilingual hands-on lab</a> presented by Aimee Degnan of Hook42 and myself from Acquia. The schedule info is a bit misleading, this session spans two timeslots and lasts two hours. Bring your laptop with Drupal 8 freshly installed!</li>
<li>Dive deeper into the APIs of Drupal 8! Francesco Placella from Tag1 presents <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/multilingual-content-d8-highly-evolved-permutated-api">Multilingual Content in D8: a Highly Evolved Permutated API</a> showing how to code with the new system. While not strictly multilingual, in <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/field-api-dead-long-live-entity-field-api">Field API is dead. Long live Entity Field API!</a> swentel, yched and amateescu show how the most essential content element storage system changed and this is full of multilingual support of course.</li>
</ul><h3>Multilingual Drupal 7 site building and programming</h3>
<ul><li><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/multilingual-site-setup-and-management-building-multilingual-multi-country-e-commerce-site">Multilingual Site Setup and Management</a> is a half hour session from Robert Vandenberg and Rob Bailey of Lingotek back to back with <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/multilingual-site-setup-and-management-building-multilingual-multi-country-e-commerce-site">Building a multilingual &amp; multi-country e-commerce site for luxury brands</a> another half hour talk from Arthur Murauskas of Adyax with real life examples.</li>
<li>Dagmar Muth and Urs Bucher from Amazee Labs are presenting <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/building-multilingual-multidomain-drupal-site">Building a Multilingual, Multidomain Drupal Site</a> synthesizing their experience from multiple customers.</li>
<li>I proposed the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/bof/multilingual-therapy-questions-and-answers">Multilingual therapy (questions and answers)</a> BoF again! Waiting experienced folks as well as everyone with questions. You'll see even if you arrive with several questions, you can answer others! There is no set agenda, just to answer all the questions!</li>
</ul><h3>Moving localize.drupal.org forward</h3>
<p>The localize.drupal.org site seriously needs people who care about it enough to devote time to maintaining and fixing bugs. I set up one more BoF to gather people interesting in the well-being of this site titled <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/bof/we-love-localizedrupalorg">We love localize.drupal.org</a>. We need to upgrade to Drupal 7, support the whole range of new Drupal 8 APIs, drastically improve performance and then get new features going.</p>
<hr /><p>These are all the multilingual pieces that I collected. There may still be more, BoF scheduling just started and I may have missed a session or two. Let us know in the comments what other great events happen around multilingual Drupal. See you in Amsterdam!</p>
