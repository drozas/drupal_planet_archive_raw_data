This is a question we get asked a lot at Drupalize.Me. Our theming and module development videos often assume that you're familiar with basic HTML and CSS. But not everyone is, and you've got to start somewhere. At the moment, creating HTML and CSS vidoes is low on our list of priorities. We're not saying we'll never do it, but for now we serve our members best by rocking Drupal-specific content. And there's already a lot of great resources available for HTML and CSS. I thought I'd share some of my favorites here. I also tapped the Lullabot "hivemind" for additional recommendations. </p>
