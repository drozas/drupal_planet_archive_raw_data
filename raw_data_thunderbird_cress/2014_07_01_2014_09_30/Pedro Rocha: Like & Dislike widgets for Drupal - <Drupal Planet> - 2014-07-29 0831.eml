    It sounds simples, but while Drupal has the awesome Voting API, with Fiverstar, Vote Up/Down and many other voting like modules, we didn't have a "ready to use" solution for a "Like" widget, as we see on Facebook and many other social networks. Another issue is that many people avoid, but sometimes we do need the "Dislike" widget too. Until Like &amp; Dislike module!
