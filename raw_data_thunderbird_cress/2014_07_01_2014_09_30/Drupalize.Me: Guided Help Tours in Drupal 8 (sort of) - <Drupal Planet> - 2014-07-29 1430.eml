    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden text-content text-secondary"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div>One of the neat new things in Drupal 8 is something called the Tour module. It is built on the <a href="http://zurb.com/playground/jquery-joyride-feature-tour-plugin">Joyride jQuery plugin</a>, which provides a clickable tour of HTML elements on your website. It gives you a way to walk a new user through your site or a particular interface with text instructions and next buttons. If you're not sure what this all means or looks like, have a look at the video below to see it in action in Drupal 8.</div>

<div>I was drawn to investigating the Tour module because I love ways of helping people through documentation. The Drupal core help system is an old system, and there have been many discussions and attempts to update it in the past. Tour certainly doesn't replace the help pages at this point, but it is an interesting new tool. So what exactly is going on with it in Drupal 8? Will we have a fancy new tours all over a default installation? Well, no. As it stands right now, there is only one tour in Drupal 8, which is for the Views building interface. It was submitted as a proof of concept with the Views module in core. So what's the deal?</div>
