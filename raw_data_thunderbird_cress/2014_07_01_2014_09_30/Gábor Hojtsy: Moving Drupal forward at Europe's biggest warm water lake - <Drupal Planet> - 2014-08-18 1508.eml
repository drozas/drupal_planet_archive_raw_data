I got involved pretty late in the organization when we added sprinting capacity on all four days, but I must say doing that was well worth it. While the pre-planned schedule of the event focused on longer full day and half day workshops on business English, automation, rules, commerce, multilingual, etc. the sprint was thriving with backend developer luminaries such as Wim Leers, dawehner, fago, swentel, pfrennsen, dasjo as well as sizable frontend crew such as mortendk, lewisnyman, rteijeiro, emmamaria, etc. This setup allowed us to work on a very wide range of issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?issue_tags=Drupalaton%202014">The list of 70+ issues we worked on</a> shows our work on the drupal.org infrastructure, numerous frontend issues to clean up Drupal's markup, important performance problems, several release critical issues and significant work on all three non-postponed beta blockers at the time.</p>

<p>Our coordinated timing with <a href="http://2014.tcdrupal.org/sprints">the TCDrupal sprints</a> really helped in working on some of the same issues together. We successfully closed one of the beta blockers shortly after the sprint thanks to coordinated efforts between the two events.</p>
<p>Our list of issues also shows the success of the Rules training on the first day in bringing new people in to porting Rules components, as well as work on other important contributed modules: fixing issues with the Git deploy module's Drupal 8 port and work on the Drupal 8 version of CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>Thanks to the organizers, <a href="http://2014.drupalaton.hu/sponsors">the sponsors of the event</a> including <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/grants">the Drupal Association Community Cultivation Grants program</a> for enabling us to have some of the most important Drupal developers work together on pressing issues, eat healthy and have fun on the way.</p>
<p><em>Ps. There is never a lack of opportunity to work with these amazing people. <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/427578">Several days of sprints are coming up around DrupalCon Amsterdam</a> in a little over a month! The weekend sprint locations before/after the DrupalCon days are also really cool! See you there!</em></p>
