<p>The monthly security release window for Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core will take place on Wednesday, August 6.</p>
<p><strong>Take note of the change in schedule!</strong> The security release window is normally the third Wednesday of the month, but we are moving it up for this month only to better coordinate various schedules.  Apologies for any inconvenience this change might cause.</p>
<p>This does not mean that a Drupal core security release will necessarily take place on that date for either the Drupal 6 or Drupal 7 branches, only that you should prepare to look out for one (and be ready to update your Drupal sites in the event that the Drupal security team decides to make a release).</p>
<p>Due to the change in schedule and the fact that the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.30">Drupal 7.30</a> bug fix release was just a week ago, there will be no bug fix release in August; the next window for a Drupal core bug fix release is Wednesday, September 3.</p>
<p>For more information on Drupal core release windows, see the documentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info#when">release timing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173280">security releases</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/260803">discussion</a> that led to this policy being implemented.</p>
