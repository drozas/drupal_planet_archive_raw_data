    <p>Today I found myself in a complex <a href="https://twitter.com/brianwisti/status/503987766032494592">codebase</a> and my ticket was: this JS on this old page <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/221658">makes the monkey dance</a>, can you make it dance on the new page? Well, my JS knowledge is... limited but I have a really mean right click. So I right clicked and looked around the source Chrome showed me. There was a div with a class <code>slideshow-node-embed-processed</code>. Now that's important: <code>-processed</code> is added by the jQuery once plugin that Drupal 7 happens to ships with. It's much easier to recognize the handiwork of the plugin than actually use it -- this is true for many similar reverse engineering scenarios. Next step is <code>ag slideshow-node-embed</code> (you have <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">ag</a> installed, don't you?) which comes back with a single JS file called <code>sites/all/themes/foo/js/node-embed.js</code>. Next <code>ag -A2 -B2 node-embed.js</code> -- just searching is pointless but by adding some context to it hopefully we can see some settings or CSS necessary.</p>
