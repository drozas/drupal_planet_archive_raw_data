<p>Our DrupalCon Austin Recap will cover all the results of the Con, from the logistics to the sessions, to the marketing, to the finances. There is a lot of great news to report, along with some really great questions that we are going to have to answer to continue to improve the conference.</p>
<p>Licensing on Drupal.org has been an issue for a very long time now. With so much contributed content, so few volunteers in this area, and with little guidance, the policies we do have in place have been applied inconsistently and some issues that have been reported have never really been addressed. I pulled together a group of folks who have been working on licensing over the years and they developed a proposal for the board's consideration about how to best move forward to provide clear, consistent, and timely action for licensing issues. </p>
<p>All of <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/association.drupal.org/?tab=co#folders/0B8gZDNT4xrvZLV80d1ZxT1gwaW8">the materials for the board meeting</a> can be found online, and we hope you'll <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1984701308497140226">join us on 20 August</a>!</p>
