    <p>I've been playing with D7 forms lately and have found #states to be somewhat challenging due to lack of documentation on <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer!topics!forms_api_reference.html/7#states">Form API page</a>.<br />
I've poked around a bit and decided to write a blog with my findings in case someone else is in need of this info down the road.<br />
If you are looking for a robust solution for conditional fields, I would suggest looking into <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/conditional_fields">conditional fields</a>.</p><ul class="links inline"><li class="0 first last"><a href="http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/drupal-7-form-api-using-states-multiple-conditionals-and-or-and-xor" rel="tag" title="Drupal 7 Form API: Using #states with multiple conditionals (AND, OR and XOR)">Read more</a></li>
