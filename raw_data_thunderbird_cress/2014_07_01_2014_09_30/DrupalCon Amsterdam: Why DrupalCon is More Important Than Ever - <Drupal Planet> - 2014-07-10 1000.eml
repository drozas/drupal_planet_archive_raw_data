<p>DrupalCon has always served as an important forum to discuss the status of the project as well as a great place to learn Drupal skills from the experts. But technology moves fast. It’s no longer sufficient to focus solely on today’s challenges. That’s why DrupalCon has evolved into a one-of-a-kind event to not only help attendees solve the problems they face today, but also plan for the future. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Insight:</strong> At every DrupalCon, Drupal founder and project lead Dries Buytaert and other project leaders have a conversation with the community about the future of Drupal. Each DrupalCon serves as a stake in the ground for the project on important issues that include release cycles, milestones, processes, and Drupal software improvements. Having access to this roadmap information is crucial for making your own decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Drupal 8</strong>: The next release of Drupal is packed with more than 200 great improvements and will have something for everyone to love. There is also something for everyone to learn. Attending DrupalCon will give you access to the foremost Drupal 8 experts in the world and help make sure you are ready with Drupal 8 knowledge and skills when your clients and colleagues need you. </li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: DrupalCon is where fruitful relationships are ignited, nurtured and advanced. The event offers countless opportunities to meet face-to-face with the peers, companies and talent that will help you be successful now and in the future.</li>
</ul><p>Attendance at DrupalCon events continues to grow. The importance of attending is growing as well. We hope to see you there! </p>
