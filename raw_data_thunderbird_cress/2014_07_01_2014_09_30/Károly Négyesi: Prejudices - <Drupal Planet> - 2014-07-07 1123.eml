    <p>At Szeged, I asked a female Drupal contributor in Hungarian (I'm glad she did not understand) what was up with the coffee maker, because I readily presumed she was staff.<br />
I saw one of the female geek role models at Austin with her baby. I got confused for a second, because apparently I think the <em>übergeek</em> and <em>mother</em> roles can't overlap.<br />
On IRC, I almost said "Wow, that's impressive from a girl.".<br />
I do not know how I can avoid these thoughts, but I am aware of them, I am bothered by them, and I try not to act on them. I also try to point out to fellow Drupalers when they act on their thoughts that these are not appropriate. I'm not sure what else I can do.<br />
If you have good ideas on overcoming prejudice, please share!</p>
