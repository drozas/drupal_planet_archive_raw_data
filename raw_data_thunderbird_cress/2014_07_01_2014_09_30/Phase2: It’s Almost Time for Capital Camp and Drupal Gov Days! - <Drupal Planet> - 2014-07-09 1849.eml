    <p>We could not be more excited that two of our favorite DC events &#8211; <a href="http://2014.capitalcampandgovdays.com/">Capital Camp and Drupal 4 Gov</a> &#8211; are merging! The combined event, happening July 30th through August 1st at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/National+Institutes+of+Health/@39.004052,-77.101585,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x942022cafe272de2">National Institutes of Health</a>, promises to be one of the most informative and inspiring conferences on Drupal and  open source in government yet.
