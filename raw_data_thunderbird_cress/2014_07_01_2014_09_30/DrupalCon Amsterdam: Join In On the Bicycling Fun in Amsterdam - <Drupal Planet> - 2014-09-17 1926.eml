In the immortal words of Queen: “all I wanna do is bicycle!” If you’re heck on two wheels and love nothing more than the feeling of the wind on your face and pavement whizzing underneath your wheels, you may want to consider joining in the Tour de Drupal leading up to DrupalCon Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Drupalers from countries all across Europe are teaming up for the Tour de Drupal, an epic bike ride from the UK and Switzerland to Amsterdam. Taking place the weekend before DrupalCon Amsterdam, the triumphant arrival of the Drupalcyclistas is expected on Sunday, September 28th between 4 and 5 PM at Eta Vondelpark in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>It’s not too late to join in on the bike ride, where you can find information <a href="http://tourdedrupal.drupalgardens.com/">here</a>. Of course, if cross-country bicycling doesn’t do it for you but you still want to cruise around with a crew of awesome folks, consider renting a Yellow Bike during DrupalCon Amsterdam. For €50, you can rent a bike, a bike helmet, two bike locks, a bike map of greater Amsterdam, and insurance. The rental is from Monday-Friday. You can find more information <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/travel#transit">here</a>.<br />
There are a lot of passionate bikers in the Drupal community— and we all care about our causes, too. UK Tour de Drupaler Alan Burke is combining his love of biking and charity by participating in a two-day, 360 kilometer cycle around Galway for charity. For more information about Alan’s ride, <a href="http://www.mycharity.ie/event/ab_giro_galway">click here</a>. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether you fly, bike, or take a train— we’re looking forward to seeing you in Amsterdam.</p>
