There are many engineering, project and other risks associated with it. More often than not, budget and deadline overrun occurs.</p><p>Moreover, large projects often result in a prolonged Q/A, testing and troubleshooting period which once again can pose additional risks. </p><p>Propeople was recently presented with the following challenge by a client:</p><div><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Image1.jpg" alt="Project by the Numbers" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><!--MEDIA-WRAPPER-END-1--></div><div> </div><ul><li><p>1200 budget hours</p></li><li><p>2 month of development time</p></li><li><p>4 developers</p></li><li><p>1 hard launch date</p></li></ul><p>To add another challenge to the mix, there was minimal Q/A engineer availability for the project.</p><p>In order to meet the client’s budget and timeline requirements above, we needed to rethink a new development workflow that largely incorporated quality into the project in order to meet both the deadline and budget requirements. </p><div> </div><h2>Typical Development Workflow</h2><div> </div><p>Propeople selected GIT as the revisioning software to manage the development process/workflow for the project. GIT is a popular, open source distributed versioning system used by many organizations of all sizes. For more information on GIT, you can visit this site.</p><p>Organizations that employ a repository management system such as GIT, typically one of the following workflow models is used.</p><div> </div><h5>1. Using the Master Branch</h5><p>This workflow is typically employed by smaller organizations with a small number of developers working on the project. In this workflow, all of the code changes are committed into the master branch by all of the developers. It results in a linear development workflow:</p><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Image2.jpg" alt="Master Branch" /></p><p>This workflow works well at keeping everything simple, allowing developers to avoid branching and merging. It also allows for the creation of some tags to designate stable release or state of the code repository.</p><p>However, there are many drawbacks to this workflow. One of the most overlooked facts is that most likely, John and Joe will not check each other’s commits. Once a change is committed to the master branch, the change is incorporated into the project until someone notices any poorly written code or commits. </p><div> </div><div><h5 dir="ltr">2. Development -&gt; Stage -&gt; Production</h5><p dir="ltr">One of the most widely adopted workflows, this three-tiered workflow fully leverages GIT’s ability to create and merge branches. It also gives web developers the ability to mirror the branches to a different “working environment” so that they can have:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Development website</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Staging website</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p>Production website</p></li></ul><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Image3.jpg" alt="Development, Stage, Production" /></p></div><h5>3. Feature Branch</h5><p>We ultimately chose to adopt a “feature” branch workflow for this project. This model takes advantage of the git branching/merging model. It is also chosen because we did not necessarily need a “staging” or “production” environment during the agile development phase.</p><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Image4.jpg" alt="Feature Branch" /></p><p>This workflow works well at keeping everything simple, allowing developers to avoid branching and merging. It also allows for the creation of some tags to designate stable release or state of the code repository.</p><p>However, there are many drawbacks to this workflow. One of the most overlooked facts is that most likely, John and Joe will not check each other’s commits. Once a change is committed to the master branch, the change is incorporated into the project until someone notices any poorly written code or commits. </p><p> </p><div><h2>Introduction of Github and the Magical Pull Request</h2><p> </p><p>One of the biggest reasons that we adopted the feature branch approach is Github. Github.com is one of the longest-running and most popular hosted git management platforms. It offers many developer friendly tools. One of the most useful and popular tools and functions is the Pull Request.</p><div> </div><div><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/454mP.jpg" alt="CI" /></div><h2>Looking ahead</h2><p>We are looking ahead to adding automated regression testing to the pull requests. This will allow developers to easily see page changes caused by their commits.</p><p>A more integrated issue and time tracking system would help consolidate all of the project efforts into Github. We used a separate issue tracking and hour tracking system for the project.</p><div> </div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Largely due to the new development workflow, we were able to meet the the hard deadline set by client. Although the project had a <strong>8%</strong> budget overrun, this number is a great success, given the <strong>27%*</strong> industry average. We were also able to reduce our post launch Q/A cycle by <strong>66.67%</strong>, from 30 days to 10 days.</p><p>A big thanks to the masterminds behind the new development workflow:</p><p>Yuriy Gerasimov (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/257311">https://www.drupal.org/user/257311</a>)</p><p>Andriy Podanenko (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/podarok">https://www.drupal.org/u/podarok</a>)</p><p> </p><p>* <a href="http://hbr.org/2011/09/why-your-it-project-may-be-riskier-than-you-think/">http://hbr.org/2011/09/why-your-it-project-may-be-riskier-than-you-think/</a></p></div><p> </p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/tags/ci" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">CI</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/tags/git" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">GIT</a></div><div class="field-item even"><a href="/tags/continuous-integration" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Continuous Integration</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/tags/qa" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Q/A</a></div><div class="field-item even"><a href="/tags/project" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Project</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-service-category field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Service category:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/services/technology" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Technology</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-drupal-planet field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Check this option to include this post in Planet Drupal aggregator:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/drupal/planet" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">planet</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-topics field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Topics:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/topics/tech-development" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Tech &amp; Development</a></div></div></div>
