My laptop was in serious danger of getting hurled across the room, due to my frustration. Then I discovered drush, and downloading and enabling modules was now performed with ease instead of pain and suffering. Of course there's a lot more you can do with drush than just download and enable modules, this is just one example.</p>

<p>I've been using Drush 6.x on my local machine for quite some time now. Poking around Drupal 8's UI and seeing what's new, I haven't missed drush too much...until it was time to test drive a new contrib module for Drupal 8. When I typed into my Terminal window <code>drush dl page_manager</code>, I got quite the error message:</p>

If I wanted to use Drush on my Drupal 8 site, I would need to upgrade to Drush 7.x.</p></div></div></div><div id="comment-wrapper-nid-1748"></div>
