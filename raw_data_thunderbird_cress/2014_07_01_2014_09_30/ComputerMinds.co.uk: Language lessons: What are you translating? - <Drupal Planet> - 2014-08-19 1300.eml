<p>It seems an obvious question to ask, but <em>what are you translating?</em></p>

<p>The tools exist to translate just about anything in Drupal 7*, but in many different ways, so you need to know exactly what you're translating. Language is 'a first-class citizen', in the sense that any piece of text is inherently written by someone on some language, which Drupal 7 is built to recognise. Sometimes you want to translate each &amp; every individual piece of text (e.g. at the sentence or paragraph level). Other times you want to translate a whole page or section that is made up of multiple pieces of text.</p></div></div></div><span rel="schema:url" resource="/drupal-code/language-lessons-what-are-you-translating" class="rdf-meta"></span><span property="schema:name" content="Language lessons: What are you translating?" class="rdf-meta"></span>
