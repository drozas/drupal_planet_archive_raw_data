    <p>Fact: Using the Update module for collecting data has been the standard since Drupal 6.0.<br />Another fact: Sites not using that module aren't submitting usage statisticsÂ to drupal.org.<br />Yet another fact: Third-party monitoring services are rendering the Update module rather useless.<br />Result: Misleading statistics on Drupal core and module usage.</p>
<p>When Drupal 6.0 was released the Update module started submitting statistics to Drupal.org, a great initiative. Though, you can disable this module for different reasons, thus creating misleading statistics on Drupal.org. The same goes for Drupal 7, you can disable the module there as well.</p>
