<p>Not even close! Building the site is only the beginning: every website needs to be deployed, hosted, monitored, maintained, upgraded, security patched, scaled, and more— and if you start thinking about those things only after finishing your site, you’re bound to run into trouble.</p>
<p>Fortunately, DrupalCon Amsterdam is here to help! <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/sessions/accepted?field_experience_value=All&amp;field_track_value=DevOps&amp;field_drupal_version_value=All&amp;combine=">We’ll be running a #devops track</a> that will bring devs and ops closer together. We’ll be discussing ways to achieve easier deployments, as well as how to ensure better stability, scalability and security for your big, beautiful Drupal website.</p>
<p>We've got a bunch of awesome speakers with experience in all of the above topics, as well as: </p>
<li>managing large sites, </li>
<li>doing continuous delivery of applications,</li>
<li>automated testing to improve quality</li>
<p>... and many more topics that you should think about when building that beautiful website that can't afford to go down.</p>
<p>The DrupalCon Amsterdam DevOps track will feature a broad range of talks covering the various technologies used in devops—  and we expect it will be a nice counterpart to the traditional Drupal-centric tracks. These DevOps sessions will give you a perfect opportunity to peek into new technologies and talk with the best people working on those solutions.</p>
<p>Whether you are putting together a small internal application or a large, popular, internet-facing site, your job does not end at the last commit. So join us in learning how to release stronger and better software faster. We’re all in this together, so let’s share the love and learn from each other!</p>
