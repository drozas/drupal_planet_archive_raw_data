	In <a href="/blog/deliver-digital-faster-drupal-part-1">Deliver digital faster with Drupal Part 1</a>, I showed you some of the many examples of successful sites built rapidly thanks to Drupal’s modularity. To stay ahead of your competition, you need to be nimble and agile; Drupal helps you do this with reusable, transferable digital experiences that can be customised to suit various niches even within a single business enterprise. All, of course, without paying additional license fees or mandated limits on developers, environments, or copies.
