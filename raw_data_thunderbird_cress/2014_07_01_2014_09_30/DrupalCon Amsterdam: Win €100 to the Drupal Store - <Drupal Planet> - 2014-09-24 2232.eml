<p>We're excited about the great swag we've got at the Drupal store-- so excited that we're going to award a €100 gift card to a lucky winner at DrupalCon Amsterdam!</p>
<h3>Here's how it works.</h3>
<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, we are going to hide puzzle pieces around the RAI Convention center. (The puzzle, for reference, is above!) If you find one of the puzzle pieces, bring it by the Drupal Association Booth in the exhibit hall.</p>
<p>We'll write your name and contact information on the back, and once the puzzle is complete-- or, at lunch on Thursday, whichever happens first-- we will select a lucky winner and award him or her with a €100 gift card!</p>
<p>Pro tip: during the hours the exhibit floor is open, we'll use the <a href="http://twitter.com/drupalassoc">@DrupalAssoc</a> Twitter handle to send out pictures of where the puzzle pieces are hidden. Keep your eye on that handle so you can have a shot at finding one of the pieces and winning the prize!</p>
<p><strong>Note: there are only 15 puzzle pieces, so the odds of winning are great. Limit one puzzle piece per person.</strong></p>
<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>Come by the Drupal Association booth next to the bookstore or email <a href="mailto:leigh@association.drupal.org">Leigh Carver</a> with any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
