    <p>I have been fighting against shipping Drupal 8 with the Symfony CMF based router since April. By then, it was way too late and for better or worse it'll happen now. so that is not the issue any more (any comments relating to this will be deleted). However, I just could not stomach this, I have stomached too many things in D8 I disagree with and I simply quit core development to stop the stress. I will finish my entity work but nothing else. One could ask -- why was it too late? Why I didn't react earlier? As some of you know, I was trying to keep up with the RTBC queue, yet some patches slipped, and this definitely did. See below why -- and we need to rethink our core process to make sure something like this does not occur again.</p>

<p>Ps. Note that the 24 hours would've been way too little. Issues usually stand at RTBC for days or a few weeks. Right now the oldest RTBC issue is three weeks old.</p>
<p>PPS. If you are saying there were discussions before, that's irrelevant, you can't possibly expect to keep up with every abstract discussion, it's enough trying to review patches when they are deemed done.</p>
