    <div>As a designer I often feel out of my element whenever I have to  crank open an FTP client (or even command line) into my site to perform  file backups on a regular basis. It gets worse when you have to perform  database backups, you usually have to use a third party tool like  phpMyAdmin which leaves the uniformed user open to making tragic  mistakes. No one ever wants to have the sinking feeling of attempting to  restore from a faulty backup.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Do you know what all of this means?
