<h3>Maintaining the core Taxonomy module </h3>
<p>In December of 2011, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/35733">catch</a> proposed that I become a <a href="https://drupal.org/contribute/core-maintainers#component">core component maintainer</a> for taxonomy. Joining core's rockstars in MAINTAINERS.txt was both exciting and humbling, and also (though I didn't know it at the time) an important step in my career. Over the following eighteen months, I took on bigger and bigger things--first the <a href="https://drupal.org/core-mentoring">core mentoring program</a>, then <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1805996">Views in Drupal Core</a>, and now my new role as the <a href="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/blog/my-new-job-octo">OCTO Code and Community Strategist</a>. Now that helping the community mange Drupal 8 toward its release is essentially my full-time job, I don't have much time for taxonomy anymore. So, I'm looking for help!</p>
<h3>What you'd do</h3>
<p>Work with me to:</p>
<ol><li>Check for <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?status=14&amp;version=8.x&amp;component=taxonomy.module">RTBC 8.x taxonomy issues</a> every few days, and help the core maintainers by ensuring that our RTBCs have clear, up-to-date <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/294403">issue summaries</a> and that they meet basic requirements like the <a href="https://drupal.org/core-gates">core gates</a>.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=Open&amp;priorities%5B%5D=1&amp;priorities%5B%5D=4&amp;categories%5B%5D=bug&amp;categories%5B%5D=task&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;component%5B%5D=taxonomy.module">major and critical taxonomy issues</a>: Make sure their summaries are up to date, that the next step is clear, and that they are actually major or critical.</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1426582">Triage</a> the open <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=Open&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;version%5B%5D=7.x&amp;component%5B%5D=taxonomy.module">8.x and 7.x taxonomy queue</a> once a week or so to make sure issues are filed correctly (including making sure issues are fixed in 8.x first as per the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=Open&amp;priorities%5B%5D=1&amp;priorities%5B%5D=4&amp;categories%5B%5D=bug&amp;categories%5B%5D=task&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;component%5B%5D=taxonomy.module">backport policy</a>) and to get more information when needed.</li>
<li>Identify potential <a href="https://drupal.org/new-contributors">novice</a> tasks among open taxonomy issues, and post and monitor them on the <a href="http://drupalmentoring.org/">core mentoring website</a>.</li>
<li>Bring any important questions or discussion to my attention.</li>
</ol><p>If you think you might be able to take some of that on, but you're not sure about all of it--don't worry! I'd help you with each part. I'd hope that you'd do these things at least through the release of 8.0, and afterward as well if you are up for it.</p>
<h3>What you'd get out of it</h3>
<ul><li>Insight into Drupal core process.</li>
<li>Direct exposure to what's new and exciting in Drupal 8, particularly the new <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1400186">Entity and Field API</a>.</li>
<li>1:1 mentoring from xjm. ;)</li>
<li>Karma! People who work on core will recognize your contributions, and so that makes it easier for them to help and support you in return.</li>
<li>Seriously, is there anything more awesome than having your name in every copy of Drupal that gets downloaded?</li>
</ul><h3>How to "apply"</h3>
<p>Just start doing the thing I listed above, and ping me! (Either use my <a href="https://drupal.org/user/65776/contact">contact form</a>, or <a href="http://drupal.org/irc">ping me on IRC</a>.) When it appears that you have a handle on things, I'll roll the patch to add you to MAINTAINERS.txt myself. :)</p>
<h3>What about other components?</h3>
<p>Does this sound like something you'd like to take on, but you have a different component in mind than Taxonomy? We need active maintainers in all our components, so let me know and I'll help you get in touch with the who's-who for the component you're interested in.</p>
<h3>Want to help, but not ready to commit to MAINTAINERS.txt?</h3>
<p>That's awesome too! I'd love to have "lieutenants" to help me with some of the tasks listed above. Let me know and we'll get you started. :)</p>
<p>See you in the queues!</p>
