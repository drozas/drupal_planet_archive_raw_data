I posted <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/300858#comment-931193">a report of the site visit</a> to the venue earlier this month, but the ink on the contracts is only now just drying.</p>
<p>For anyone who knows of GLADCamp's brief history, this has been a very long road for the conference and our organizing team. Coming to an agreement with the Hilton Pasadena is a large milestone for us. Now that both the venue and the dates are set, we can begin planning our our general conference dedicated to all things <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. </p>
<p>We have conference space for 3 days of trainings, summits dedicated to how Drupal is used in business, higher education and for the civic good, pre- and post-camp parties and code sprints, 5 simultaneous tracks of sessions, and room for up to 400 attendees from all over the Greater Los Angeles Area and around the world.</p>
<p>If you're interested in joining the organizing team or just hearing of news as it develops, follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/GLADCamp">GLADCamp</a> and join the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/gladcamp">GLADCamp Working Group</a>.</p>
