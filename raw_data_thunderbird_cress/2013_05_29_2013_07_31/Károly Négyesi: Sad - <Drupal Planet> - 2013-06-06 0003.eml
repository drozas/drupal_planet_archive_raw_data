    <p>There are a number of Drupal 8 issues that simply make me <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=sad%20chx">sad</a>. I still didn't stop contributing to Drupal nor I plan to, I just need to accept that we have some disagreements which are not getting resolved. It's frustrating and I am mostly just venting so comments are disabled. (It's frustrating enough that I went over them to tag them.) </p>
<p>Ps. There's a little silver lining: the config import code has been rewritten finally. Still, I will not touch CMI.</p>
