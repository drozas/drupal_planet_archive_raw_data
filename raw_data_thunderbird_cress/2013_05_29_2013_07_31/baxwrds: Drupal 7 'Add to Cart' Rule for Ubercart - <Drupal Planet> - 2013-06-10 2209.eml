    <p>On a current site in development I am using Ubercart to provide a renewable subscription service.  To make the user experience clean, I wanted to protect the user from going 'shopping' to add their subscription.  To do this I decided to use a rule to add the product to the user cart when the user is created by an administrator or when the subscription is cancelled or fails payment.  I tried the Ubercart Rules module, but this is mainly for dealing with orders and not carts, and did not contain the needed add to cart rule.</p>
