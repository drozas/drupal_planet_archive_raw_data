    <p>On Saturday 20th, Jesús and I visited Santander for attending the <a href="http://2013.drupalday.es">Drupal Day</a>. The 
Drupal Day is an itinerant <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term143"><dfn title="An event in Drupal can have two different meanings. 1) any change in state of a page or piece of content, e.g. a node being set to “published” could be an “event” which triggers its inclusion in the site's RSS feed. Similarly, “event” can also refer to Javascript triggers such as, a “mouse-over” (aka “hover”) event, a completed page load, etc. And 2) “event”, of course, can also have the meaning of a calendar event, e.g. a node created with the Event module (something now more commonly done with the Date and Calendar modules, which work together to provide another solution for “event” scheduling).">event</dfn></a> organized by the <a href="http://asociaciondrupal.es">Spanish Drupal Association</a> with a local Drupal community.</p>

<p>Around 80 drupalistas were there, and we had very interesting session, mostly centered around the new things that are coming with Drupal 8. Is a great thing that more and more people in the Spanish community is getting involved in <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term136"><dfn title="Drupal “core” includes only the files and modules found in the main Drupal project download.">core</dfn></a> contributions and attending international events, and IMHO this is making Spanish events more interesting every time.
