             <p>This is a tutorial for installing and setting up the commercial InnoCompany Theme that retails for around $45 in the US (Â£32 or so in the UK). The theme offers a multi-purpose corporate solution, but my own use is to create a portfolio site. I consider myself a back-end Drupal dev first and foremost, and my feeling is it would take me too long to create a neat portfolio site (which must of course be Drupal) from scratch. That effort would detract from my paid work for my clients and the <i>pro bono</i> weekend work I undertake for charities. </p>
