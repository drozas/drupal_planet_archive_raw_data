    <p>Amitai returned from DrupalCon Portland reporting it was raining all the time, the flights were very long (apparently the &quot;Gizra Platinum Executive Traveller&quot; card we gave him in the office failed to deliver the expected First Class upgrade) and he still doesn&#39;t really get Portlandia.</p>
