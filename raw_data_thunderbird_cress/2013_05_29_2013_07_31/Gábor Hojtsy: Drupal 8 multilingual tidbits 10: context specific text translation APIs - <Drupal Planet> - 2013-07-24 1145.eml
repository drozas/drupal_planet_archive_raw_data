There are several new translation APIs for software translation in Drupal 8. Prior Drupal versions had the rule that you should use t() and format_plural() with little exceptions. Drupal 8 has much more complexity in this area, which may be a bliss or a curse depending on how you look at it. It definitely brings translation support to several areas that were not or poorly covered before. Buckle up, this 'tidbit' is more like a deep-dive into the woods of the API!</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable with code-talk, your key take-away should be that we now support a bigger part of the software to translate and in more flexible ways. We'll cover configuration translation from the user perspective for example in detail in later tidbits.</p>
