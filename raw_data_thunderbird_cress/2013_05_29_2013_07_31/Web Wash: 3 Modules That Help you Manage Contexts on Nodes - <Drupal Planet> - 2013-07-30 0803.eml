Ever since its release in Drupal 6, I have used it on many Drupal websites. Due to its popularity and flexibility, there are a lot of contributed modules that extend Context even further.</p>

<p>I won't go into details about what Context is, but if you want to learn more check out the <a href="http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/1784/why-context-module-so-popular-how-does-it-help">answers in this Drupal Answers question</a>.</p>

<p>The three modules that I'll discuss today are: <a href="https://drupal.org/project/context_node">Context Node</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/project/context_by_node">Context by Node</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/context_field">Context Field</a>. The module names may be a bit confusing but they all serve a particular purpose.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll have a quick look at all three modules and see how they work and differ.</p>
