    <p>A quick announcement that we're starting porting of the Backbone module to D8. While Backbone is in core, that will most likely not include library functions for handling Drupal RESTful sync'ing in the client. The Backbone module will continue to hold JS implementations for easy integration with Drupal's new REST services, and some convenience models for working with Drupal entities in JS and common entity types.</p>
<p>If you're interested in being involved, please don't hesitate to message me on d.o!</p>
