        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>With the 4.3 upgrade, the Progressive Technology Project has made a number of important steps toward breaking out our work into pieces that others can use on their sites. This blog will begin a series of (hopefully) weekly blogs outlining new functionality that others can use.</p>
<p>Our first blog features the civicrm_petition_email Drupal module. Thanks to the hard work of agh1, a Drupal 6 version of the module is available (https://github.com/agh1/civicrm_petition_email). We just finished porting it to Drupal 7.</p>
<p>For the impatient:</p>
<p> git clone git://git.progressivetech.org/powerbase/civicrm_petition_email</p>
<p>With this module enabled, there are a few new checkboxes on the petition form that allow you to specify the name and email address of a target that should get notified every time the petition is filled out. In addition, you can optionally specify a field in the petition that should be used as a custom message to the target instead of the default message (which is also configurable).</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
