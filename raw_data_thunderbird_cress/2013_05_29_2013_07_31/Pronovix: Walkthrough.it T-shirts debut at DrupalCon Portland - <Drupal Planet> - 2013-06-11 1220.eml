<p>The design concept pays homage to Star Wars and reflects on the popular Death Star funding campaign on Indiegogo. The front pictures the walkthrough Luke is going through to launch the Proton torpedoes that eventually destroy the Death Star, while the back sheds light on the decision of backers choosing our project over the ambitious Death Star campaign.</p>
