<p>We are currently at 70 open issues out of 212 total. Which means we fixed 68% and have 32% to go. This matches our hours spent as well. We projected 940 hours, and are currently at 68.5% spent and 31.5% left. And we do still have about half of the budget left. Though not all invoices came in yet, so this number might be a little lower. As we enter the QA phase, we expect the number of open issues to go up, which is natural. </p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-4 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Personal blog tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/taxonomy/term/588">week notes</a></div></div></div>
