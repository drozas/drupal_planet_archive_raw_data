Does your team depend on professional Drupal service providers in the Greater Los Angeles Area? Have you and your projects been affected by a shortage of Drupal development and theming talent?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to any of these questions, then consider coming to our second <strong>Drupal Employers Summit</strong> from 7-9pm on Friday, August 16, 2013. There is no charge for this event. It is open to any and all companies and organizations who qualify, by following either or both of the following criteria:</p>

</li><li>Sponsoring or exhibiting at any of the Los Angeles Drupal job fairs in June, 2011; November, 2011; or January, 2013.

</li><li>Getting the most out of our recruiting and marketing dollar;
</li><li>What we're doing now to staff up, from local recruiting and in-house training to outsourcing and hiring out-of-town or overseas;
</li><li>Identifying the skills, job titles and qualifications of desirable candidates, employees and vendors;
</li><li>Workshops, trainings and other programs that most or all of us can get behind in order to solve our business needs.
