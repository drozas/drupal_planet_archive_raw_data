<p>It's one of those "be careful what you ask for" scenarios. We've built the Drupal Commerce modules and the very successful Commerce Kickstart distribution. What happens next is pretty crazy: A niche community developed around the modules.</p>
<p>If you haven’t made an eCommerce site recently you may not be aware that Drupal Commerce has it’s own niche community. Ryan, the lead “community developer” at Commerce Guys has done his best to direct and keep up with the cat herd and really wants to share the lessons learned for all the distribution makers out there wanting to do the same.</p>
<p>With over 900 commerce-specific extensions on drupal.org, over 9,000 active users that post questions, answers, and generally talk eCommerce on drupalcommerce.org, and 28,000 active sites that are running Drupal Commerce, we have quite the active community. A whole bunch of Commerce Guys are converging upon Prague in late September. We hope you can make plans to come and hear from the ones tasked with keeping up with the community: Ryan Szrama, Josh Miller, and Aaron Dudenhofer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The beginning by Ryan Szrama</strong> - Hear about how Ryan went from a successful ubercart community and built it again for Drupal Commerce. Why should any Drupal distribution have a community site if we have Drupal.org and StackExchange? Who is the audience of niche community based around a distribution?</li>
<li><strong>A tool for the community by Aaron Dudenhofer</strong> - As most projects start for Drupal, there's definitely a need to go beyond the core modules. Thus, we have distributions. Learn how Aaron focuses less on the pretty retina icons and more on the way he can help interconnect people using the tools with the community online.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging and growing the community by Josh Miller</strong> - The current documentation lead writer, maintainer, and builder of new features on drupalcommerce.org is Josh Miller. The new Q&amp;A section, Video library section, new Showcases section were all launched by Josh in the last year. Also the current author of the popular weekly blog posts called “Commerce Module Tuesday.” Learn how Josh envisions the future growth of the community.</li>
