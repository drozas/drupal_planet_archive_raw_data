<p>European DrupalCon dates have been moved to end of September, well clear of the summer and the scholar summer holidays, and as the event does this transition, the scholarship program will too, so we’re introducing the brand new “<a href="https://association.drupal.org/drupalcon/scholarship">DrupalCon Grants and Scholarships</a>” program.</p></div></div></div>
