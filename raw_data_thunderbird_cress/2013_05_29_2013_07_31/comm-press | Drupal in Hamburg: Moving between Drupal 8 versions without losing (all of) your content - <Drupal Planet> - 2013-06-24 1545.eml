It's very spartan because I have done pretty much no configuration/theming whatsover. But it works!

My idea was to test out Drupal 8 as best I could in order to contribute whatever I find to the issue queue. What I didn't really think about was that upgrading Drupal 8 to reflect the latest development version would mean a fresh install, and the loss of any content I created. I started copy-pasting some of my articles to my old blog, but it would be nice for the articles just to stay where they are without losing too much data.

I asked on Twitter whether it was just me ...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/johnheaven">@johnheaven</a> Currently d8 does not support d8-&gt;d8 updates (would be too much work atm), that's planned for the post-codefreeze time afaik</p>â€” patrickd (@patrickd_drupal) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickd_drupal/statuses/346687341982789632">June 17, 2013</a></blockquote>
