    <p><a href="http://www.gizra.com/content/dekyll-drupal-on-jekyll/">Dekyll</a> (Drupal on Jekyll) comes now in two flavors. The first one is &quot;normal&quot;, which is more advanced and allows you to build more complex websites, the second is called &quot;Github Pages&quot; and it lets you quickly serve a new site using Github.</p>

<p>We are working hard in Gizra to make this process as smooth as possible, with the goal of letting non-developers the ability to serve their content using Jekyll, on Github Pages - without them having to bother with knowing what Jekyll, Git or Github Pages are. A worthy goal indeed, but not trivial.</p>
