    <p>I have been invited to the wonderful opportunity to come speak as part of the keynote address for <a href="http://www.nyccamp.org/">Drupal Camp NYC 13</a> this weekend. You should come too, at least if you're in New York, and you have an interest in Drupal, or just want a chance to watch me make a fool out of myself on stage.</p>
<p><img src="http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/logo-drupal-camp-nyc-eyes.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I have been invited, presumably, because of my work with the Media project of Drupal. Although I would question their choice, as my work would not have been possible without the work of the giants on whose shoulders I stand, not to mention the work of countless other developers who have and continue to contribute to making the Media project as awesome as it is. I am, as the saying goes, but a drop.</p>
<p>But regardless of my thoughts on the matter, I'm the person they've chosen to come chew your ears for ten minutes on Saturday, July 13, in the evening, following Larry Garfield, one of those giants I mentioned. So please, come to Drupal Camp NYC 13, to experience what it means to be part of the Drupal community, to learn from some of the giants in some of the many offerings available in the sessions over the weekend, to help make history in one of the sprints following the camp, or just to hear an old fool pontificate because the organizers didn't know what they were getting themselves into.</p>
<p>By the way, I've been told that 100% of the proceeds from the camp after expenses will be donated to the Special Needs Trust that has been set up for my family and me, because of my ongoing struggles with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, otherwise known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease. Just one more reason you need to be there. Plus, you'll get to hear me do my Stephen Hawking impersonation with the speech assist device I'll be using. Now if only they could make a speech-writing assist device...</p>
