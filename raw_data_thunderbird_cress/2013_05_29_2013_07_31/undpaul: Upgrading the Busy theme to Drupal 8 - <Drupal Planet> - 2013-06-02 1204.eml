There were three really good suggestions, one of them being Bartik, which the most people got behind, so it could be finished in time to get into Drupal 7 core. One really good suggestion that <a href="https://drupal.org/node/686410">couldn't be finished in time</a> was <a href="http://drupal.org/project/corolla">Corolla</a> by <a href="https://drupal.org/user/61393">Jeff Burnz</a>, which is now a contrib theme. The third suggestion was our theme Busy by <a href="https://drupal.org/user/96718">eigentor</a>, a theme targeted at corporate websites. Just like Corolla, there wasn't enough time to finish it up for Drupal 7 core. Busy has been a contributed theme ever since, because we didn't want it to get lost only because it didn't make it into Drupal core.</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-1 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/blog/tags/drupal-planet-english">drupal planet english</a></div></div></div>
