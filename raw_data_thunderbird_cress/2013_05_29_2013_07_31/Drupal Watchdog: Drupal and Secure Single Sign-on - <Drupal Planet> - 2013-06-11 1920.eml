<p>If you want to have a native, single sign-on solution that is deeply integrated into Drupal, there is really just one option: Bakery. If you aren't aware of the Bakery module, it is what creates single sign-on between sites like drupal.org and groups.drupal.org, as well as most of the DrupalCon sites.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why the module is called Bakery it's because it deals with the cookies, of course. A read through the module's code will introduce you to such cookies as the OATMEAL cookie, the CHOCOLATECHIP cookie, and a variety of others. I won't get into what they all do, but suffice to say that it's an amusing read.</p>
<p>Bakery is ideal for Drupal sites because it is capable not only of providing SSO, but also of syncing Drupal profile fields and user avatars — and handling some de-duping of accounts — on top of providing account proliferation across multiple sites.</p>
