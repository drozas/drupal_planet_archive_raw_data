Within 1 year (Q1/Q2 2014?) we will have <a href="https://drupal.org/project/usage/drupal" rel="nofollow">1 million registered Drupal installs</a>. We all know the total is higher due to mostly Drupal SaaServices that don't have the pingback enabled and we should always explain that.</p>
<p>However, 1.000.000 is still a freaking big number (11110100001001000000 in base 2 even bigger :-) and we should use this for marketing our product. Apart from the usual suspects there are not that many web based solutions that come even close to one tenth. Big proprietary CMS vendors do very well if they sell 10.000 per year.</p>
<p>All the reason to celebrate, for example by making </p>
<ol>
<li>an easy to embed history infographic,</li>
<li>an interactive timeline like <a href="http://www.google.nl/trends/explore?q=drupal#q=drupal&amp;cmpt=q" rel="nofollow">trends</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/nl/press/zeitgeist2010/" rel="nofollow">zeitgeist</a>, plotting the number of installs against events in time and or place from the community</li>
<li>press releases (they never seem to work though :-( )</li>
<li>give the one millionth Drupal user something, for example a Drupal 1.0 install on a 5 ¼" floppy disk signed by Dries</li>
</ol>
<p>For sourcing, we can use the influence, people and money of the DA (if they would be in on this), ask companies to work on this pro bono, preferably together and have a fund raiser; <i>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visualisation_1_million.svg" rel="nofollow">One tenth for one</a>"</i>; 1/10 of a monetary unit of your country per Drupal install you maintain. A dime per install per American, 10 eurocents per Drupal for EU’s, 1/10th of a Rand in South Africa etc. This shows that we are truly global and if people do not donate 10 cents but 10 dollars per install for example (we should hint to that, especially to the cheap Dutch :-) we could raise a bit as well, more than 1/10th of a million if played well.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, how should we proceed? Please follow up on <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/303718" rel="nofollow">BAM</a> on g.d.o.</p>
