    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"> <p>Around 20 employees stepped away from their work duties to attend the <a href="https://drupal.org/learn-drupal">Drupal Global Training Day</a> event on Friday 14th June hosted by Microserve at Armanda House, Bristol. Amongst them were freelancers, students, lecturers and employees in web development agencies interested in site building, theming, back-end coding and project management and eager to learn more about Drupal.</p>
<p>The event started with an introductory talk by <a href="http://www.microserveltd.co.uk/meet-team/rick-donohoe">Rick Donohoe</a>, who explained the structure of the day, the environment that the attendees would work on (<a href="http://www.acquia.com/products-services/dev-desktop" target="_blank">Acquia Dev Desktop</a>) and the goal of the training, which was a general understanding of Drupal's features. Each part of the training included demonstrations and tasks for the attendees to practice what they have been taught, in the context of building a website for an imaginary restaurant.</p>

<h2>Talks</h2>

<li>Taxonomy terms – <a href="http://www.microserveltd.co.uk/meet-team/steve-furley">Steve Furley</a>: the use of taxonomy terms in Drupal was analysed whilst creating terms for meats and using them in content types.</li>

<li>Users – <a href="http://www.microserveltd.co.uk/meet-team/nasia-notta">Nasia Notta</a>: the users, roles and permissions in Drupal were defined, the options when adding/editing/deleting a user were demonstrated and the attendees practised by creating different roles with varying permissions, which allowed them to discover the differences in content access.</li>

<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>The event according to the individual given tasks and the feedback was a success and hopefully made the attendees more eager about Drupal as a CMS and platform. The Microserve team really enjoyed it and is looking forward to another training day.</p>
