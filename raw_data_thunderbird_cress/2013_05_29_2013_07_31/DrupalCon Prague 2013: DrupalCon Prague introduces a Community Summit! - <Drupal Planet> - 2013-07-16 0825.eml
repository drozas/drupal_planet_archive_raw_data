What?! Drupal is built on community! Why are we ignoring it at DrupalCon? That is a good question, and I want to explain how we are making the community side of DrupalCon even better than in the past â€” by removing the community track from sessions, and instead creating an entire day to focus on community work. Welcome to the Community Summit.</p></div></div></div>
