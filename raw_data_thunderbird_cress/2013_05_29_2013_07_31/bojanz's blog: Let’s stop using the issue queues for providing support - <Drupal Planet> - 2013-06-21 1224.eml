We spend a lot of our time in the Drupal.org issue queues, working on bug fixes and adding new features. 
It's an okay tool for organizing development, and we've grown used to its quirks by now.
Users also try to use the issue queues to receive support, with more or less luck (typically, the bigger the module is, the less luck they have).

<p>
And while it's great to have the support request category to reclassify confused bug reports or already implemented feature requests, as an actual tool for support the issue queue is terrible and it hurts the community.
