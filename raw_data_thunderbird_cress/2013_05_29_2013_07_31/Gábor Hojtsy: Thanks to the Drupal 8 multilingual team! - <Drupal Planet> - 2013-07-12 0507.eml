    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>We just had a full-on week of sprinting in Dublin at <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Dev Days</a> recently. I think we had the biggest group and have been actively recruiting more people as they came in. The photograph below shows people gathering for the initiative meeting we had in-person. Of course this is just a small part of <a href="http://www.drupal8multilingual.org/team">the whole team</a>, which is at last count over 800 people who participated on at least one issue!</p>

<p>John Heaven made a series of videos about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBGluyY0B8">what's exciting in Drupal 8</a> as well as where people made progress in Dublin (below) and what is still to be done (to be published). Looks like I am not the only one who noticed the great results of the team! I'm really proud of all the amazing things we moved forward from the entity translation API all through cron support for localization downloads, major improvements to the internals of configuration translation and removing eval() from locale module!</p>

<p>Drupal 8 is shaping up to be outstanding for multilingual sites! I can't wait.</p>
