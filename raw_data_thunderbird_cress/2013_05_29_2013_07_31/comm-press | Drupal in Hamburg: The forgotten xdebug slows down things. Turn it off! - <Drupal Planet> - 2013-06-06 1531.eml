At the Drupalcon Portland Drupal 8 Multilingual sprint extended days, I got to sit in a room with other contributors to core, right next to people! While I was waiting for tests to run (or was it waiting for drush -y si to finish?) I complained about how slow it was. A few minutes later, a thoughtful comment from someone (someone = GÃ¡bor) was: "Do you have xdebug on? Turn it off."</p>

<p>[Aside: We say contributing to core is good for Drupal shops for many reasons. Here is another reason: devs learn stuff that improves them for when they work on client billable hours back in the shop. <a href="https://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core">Get involved with contributing to Drupal 8.</a> (Notice the link there to mentoring.) ]</p>

<p>Wow! I had turned xdebug on ages ago when debugging something and forgotten to turn it off!</p>

<p>Things are a lot faster now. :) Here are instructions for how to tell if it's enabled. To turn it off, find the lines in your php.ini and comment them out.</p>
