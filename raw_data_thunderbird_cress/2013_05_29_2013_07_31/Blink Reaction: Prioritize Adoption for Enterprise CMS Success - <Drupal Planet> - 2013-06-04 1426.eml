There’s more at stake for project teams within the enterprise. Projects are bigger than ever before. Here at Blink we continue to engage in larger and more strategic builds - true enterprise scale stuff. Enterprises are prioritizing open source solutions front and center of mission critical business process and for good reason. Open source is obviously license free and incredibly flexible. You also get the power of the “community” at your disposal.</p></div></div></div>
