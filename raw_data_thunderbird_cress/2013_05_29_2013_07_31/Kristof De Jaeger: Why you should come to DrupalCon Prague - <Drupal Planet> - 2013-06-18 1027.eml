I'll be hosting a session called 'Drupal 8 for Site Builders'. Come and watch to get an overview of all the wonders and power Drupal 8 has for creating a site.
However, there are other reasons to attend <a href="http://prague2013.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Prague</a>, and they are not Drupal related at all.</p>
<h3>Kutná Hora</h3>

<p><img src="http://realize.be/files/kutna-hora.jpg" style="border: 0; padding: 0;"></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora">Kutná Hora</a> is a little town, about 80 kilometers away from Prague, world known for its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedlec_Ossuary">Sedlec ossuary</a> which contains a lot of human bones, used for decorating the inside. While this may sound luguber, a visit to this small chapel is not something you will ever forget. And if you don't go inside, the top of the chapel has a skull, they really thought about everything. The easiest way to get there is by train and even arriving in the small station is worth travelling. I have seen it already, but will be going again, so feel free to join me.</p>

<h3>CERN opendays</h3>

<p><img src="http://realize.be/files/cern.png" style="border: 0; padding: 0;"></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is opening its doors on 28th and 29th of september for the public for it so called <a href="http://opendays2013.web.cern.ch/">CERN opendays</a>. CERN lies in Geneva, Switserland, about 8 hours driving from Prague, or maybe 1 hour flying by plane. You'll be able to go down 100 meters underground and look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">Large Hadron collider</a> and all other amazingly cool experiments scientists and engineers perform. Unless you are <a href="https://drupal.org/user/99340">Daniel "dawehner" Wehner</a>, you don't get that many chances to visit this place in your lifetime, especially since they only open it up publicly every 4 years. Tickets are for sale starting August, so keep an eye on the website if you want to go. That means I won't be attending the post-sprints, but honestly, I can live with that.</div></div></div><div class='sexybookmarks-default'></div>
