I have been part of this great team for a few months but I never had the needed time to say "Hi!". Wondering about what I should write, I thought of what Ernest Hemingway used to think: â€œDo not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know".</p></div></div></div>
