<p>When people ask you about big projects done with Drupal, what&#39;s the <em>second</em> item on your list? I know the first one is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a> - that&#39;s not Drupal&#39;s foot in the door, it&#39;s the foot that broke the door.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to share with you the second item on our list. Harvard. Seriously. If it&#39;s the first time you hear that Harvard is using Drupal, or that they have an amazing distribution they work on called <a href="http://openscholar.harvard.edu/">Harvard OpenScholar</a>, or that they have a team of five developers along with two developers from Gizra and a many <a href="http://hwp.harvard.edu/people">others</a> working on it <em>full time</em>, or you are not aware to the amount of contributions given back to the community... You do now.</p>
