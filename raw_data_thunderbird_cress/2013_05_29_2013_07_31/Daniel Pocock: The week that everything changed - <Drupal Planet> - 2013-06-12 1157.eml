    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Last Wednesday, I felt an urge to carefully write out a <a href="/the-gold-standard-in-free-communications-technology">list of all the possible characteristics that would make communications technology genuinely free.</a>  I felt this was important for a number of reasons: for example, to follow up on my earlier claim that <a href="/is-open-source-communications-software-really-free">free software does not always provide free communications</a>, it is necessary to be able to measure the shortcomings against a perfect (although possibly unachievable) benchmark.</p>
<p><em>Then something happened</em></p>
<p>Just hours after my blog was live, The Guardian, a leading British newspaper (and <a href="https://github.com/guardian">contributor to open source</a>) started publishing explosive allegations about the extent of US Government monitoring of communications.  They kicked off a dramatic four days of coverage of this topic with the story that one of America's largest phone companies, Verizon, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">is secretly passing details of all customer phone calls and approximate locations (metadata) to the NSA</a>.</p>
<p>I've published further <a href="/blog">blog entries</a> about this subject in the meantime.  One thing I want to make clear: real friends tell each other the truth.  There is no need to flatter America with gratitude for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">inventing the Internet</a> when discussing these fundamental privacy failings.  Anybody who has tried to generalise any comments about <a href="/us-surveillance-do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do">the NSA scandal</a> as `anti-American' is themselves failing to respect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States">America's own principles of free speech</a>.  A doctor doesn't make up fairy tales for a patient diagnosed with cancer, he puts the facts on the table as that is the first step in making progress.</p>
<h3>The winds of change</h3>
<p>Activity on all my free communications web sites, especially <a href="http://www.lumicall.org">Lumicall</a> and <a href="http://www.opentelecoms.org">OpenTelecoms.org</a> has doubled.  Google Play reports that the rate of Lumicall installations have also doubled - hopefully it is getting closer to the point where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe's Law</a> kicks in and everybody will have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_VoIP">federated SIP</a> on their phone.</p>
<h3>What next</h3>
<p>One thing is clear: this situation provides a huge opportunity for anybody promoting <b>free software</b>, not just for communications.  As I mentioned, web sites on the subject of free and private communications are attracting significant interest and I hope this rubs off on other projects.  While I have contended that <a href="/is-open-source-communications-software-really-free">free software does not always provide free communications</a>, there is a compelling argument for the case that <em>you can't have free communications without having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software">genuinely free software</a>.</em></p>
<p>Some of the developments that are coming up in the very near future:</p>
<p><img src="https://drupal.org/files/druplicon.small_.png" align="right" width="75" /></p>
<p>An upcoming release of <a href="http://www.drucall.org">DruCall</a>, <a href="/drupal-on-debian-libraries-api">initially packaged for Debian and leveraging the libraries API packaging scheme</a>, is going to make it much, much easier for the vast majority of web sites to offer a secure calling facility, without any third-party browser plugins required.  Other CMS vendors such as <a href="http://www.xwiki.org">xWiki</a> are also working on <a href="http://www.webrtc.org">WebRTC</a> support.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.debian.org/logos/openlogo-nd-50.png" align="left" style="padding-right:16px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://debconf13.debconf.org">DebConf13</a> is aiming to feature a half-day track on <a href="https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf13/Teams#Track_coordinators">Free real-time communications</a> with a focus on the way free operating systems, particularly Debian (and it's derivatives like <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VoIP">Ubuntu</a>) are fundamental to rolling out an alternative to the status quo.</p>
<p>Federated VoIP is also <a href="/voip-federation-another-milestone">a confirmed feature of the upcoming Fedora 19 release</a> and will eventually work it's way into EPEL.  This is another great way for people who work in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager">RPM</a> environment to start getting more active deploying SIP as a standard service in their environment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rtcquickstart.org">The real-time communication (RTC) quick-start guide</a> is currently being updated and will include a convenient web-checker to help people test their federated connectivity.</p>
