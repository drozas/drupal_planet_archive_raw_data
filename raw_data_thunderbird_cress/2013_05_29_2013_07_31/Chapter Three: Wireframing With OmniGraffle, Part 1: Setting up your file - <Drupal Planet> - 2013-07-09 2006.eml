    <p>I started using OmniGraffle to produce wireframes over a year ago and haven’t looked back. I went from spending weeks creating greybox-style, perfect wireframe in Fireworks to being able to knock out 55 pages of wireframes in two days with a UX-heavy client.  </p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This is my current wireframing process for desktop-only sites. We, and everybody else, are still figuring the best scalable approach for responsive wireframing, although I believe that OmniGraffle can easily serve that purpose as well.</em></p>
<p>I once used Adobe Fireworks to produce wireframes and design comps, but found my creativity stifled when I duplicated my wireframe document to produce the comps. Although it saved me some time, I inherited too many of the design decisions from the wireframes; the end design would feel too boxy and, well, wireframey.  </p>
<p>So, I decided to modify my process to infuse more creativity into my design comps. I always start on paper, roughly sketching out all of our design template pages. I keep these as fast and loose as possible to allow for quick iteration without overcommitting to a particular layout. Then, I move into Omnigraffle once the sketches are at a more solid place.  </p>

<p>If you’ve never used OmniGraffle before, the interface is not intuitive and can be a bit intimidating. I learned OmniGraffle through trial and error (or, more accurately, error and error, with some trial sprinkled on the side), but you don’t have to experience my pain.  </p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">get a free 14-day trial here</a>, so give yourself some time to poke around before reading much further. I also recommend skimming these resources to familiarize yourself with the basics:</p>

</ul>
<p>To get started, I create a new OmniGraffle document in which to recreate my paper wireframe. There are a number of pre-built templates available, but I start with a “blank” document.  </p>
<p><img class="imagecache-500px_wide" src="/sites/default/files/imagecache/500px_wide/template-selection.png" border="0" /> </p>
<p>OmniGraffle has a number of strange defaults for a new document, so the first thing I do is uncheck boxes in the “Canvas: Size” palette (accessible from the <em>Inspectors</em> menu).  </p>
<p><img src="/sites/default/files/canvas-size.png" border="0" width="270" height="288" /> </p>
<ol>
<li>Uncheck “Size is multiple of printer sheets”</li>
<li>Uncheck “Auto-adjust the canvas size”</li>
<li>Set “Ruler Units” to “pixels (px)”</li>
<li>Manually enter page dimensions (I usually choose 1,200 px for the width, and change the height as needed)</li>
</ol>
<p>These settings prevent my document from resizing when I drag objects around and set the ruler units to pixels, since I’m designing for the screen. You’ll also want to uncheck “Page Breaks” under the View menu. I like to drag guides from the rulers (⌘R if they’re not visible) to 100 px and 1,100 px to mark my content boundaries. This gives me 100 pixels of padding on either side of my content area. </p>
