        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>If you use the Drupal <a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform_civicrm">Webform-CiviCRM Integration</a> module, pay attention for a sec, you're going to want to know this:</p>
<p>In order to keep up with the evolution of CiviCRM and the Webform module, I've forked the Webform-CiviCRM Integration project and started work on version 4. It will be compatible with the upcoming Webform 4 and CiviCRM 4.4 (a nice convergence of the number 4). Version 3 of this module will <em>not</em> work with those, so when you upgrade one of those modules, you'll need to upgrade the other 2 as well.Â  If that's not making sense, here it is in a table:</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h4>
	What if you're already using Webform 4?</h4>
<p>Some people have already started using Webform version 4. It's still in Alpha, and the early 4.x-alpha versions weren't too different from version 3 so they actually did work with Webform-CiviCRM. My advice for you early adopers would be to <em>stop upgrading</em>. Because as of alpha-7 it has finally diverged enough that it's just not going to work nicely with Webform-CiviCRM 3 anymore. But if you stay on Webform 4-alpha6, you're good. Just hang in there for a little while until CiviCRM 4.4 and Webform-CiviCRM 4 are released, and then you can keep on upgrading to the latest version of Webform.</p>
<h4>
	Coming Soon: Payment Integration</h4>
<p>What's new in Webform-CiviCRM 4? The big news is payment integration with CiviContribute, CiviMember, and CiviEvent. You'll be able to set up a webform that can actually collect money for those things, along with all the other great benefits of a Webform like multiple event/membership regestration. You can read more about it here: <a href="http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Drupal+Webform+Payment+Integration">http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Drupal+Webform+Payment+Integration</a></p>
