    <p>A month or so ago the Drupalize.Me team started a discussion on how to start helping others learn Drupal 8. We knew Drupal 8 wasn't ready for our typical curriculum and video production process, but thought you would be interested to learn along with us about Drupal 8 as it continues to evolve. This blog post is the kick off to that series. As we stated in a <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/blog/podcasts/our-plan-learning-drupal-8">recent podcast</a> where we announced this idea, we need everyone to understand that the things we discuss are still in development and could change, or even be removed from D8 altogether.</p>
