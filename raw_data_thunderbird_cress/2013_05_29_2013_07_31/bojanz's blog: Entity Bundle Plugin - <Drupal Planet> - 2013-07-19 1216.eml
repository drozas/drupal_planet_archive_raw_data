After weeks of work <a title="Commerce License" href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce_license">Commerce License</a> is finally up, as well as <a title="Commerce File" href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce_file">Commerce File 7.x-2.x</a> to go along with it.
</p>

<p>
Commerce License provides a framework for selling access to local or remote resources.
</p>
<p>
In practice, this means that there's a license entity, usually created during order checkout, that holds information about accessing the purchased resource, and it has a status and an optional expiration date.
This allows selling access to anything from files to node types, or perhaps ZenDesk tickets and accounts on remote sites, all using a common API, while always having a record of the purchased access.
</p>
<p>
At the heart of that API is the <a title="Entity Bundle Plugin" href="http://drupal.org/project/entity_bundle_plugin">entity bundle plugin</a>, which allows different license types to have different logic.
What is entity bundle plugin? The project page says only this:
<blockquote>This API module allow developers to build an entity type which is attached to strong behaviors.</blockquote>
That doesn't help much, so let's dive in. Let's start by looking at how entities are built on D7.
