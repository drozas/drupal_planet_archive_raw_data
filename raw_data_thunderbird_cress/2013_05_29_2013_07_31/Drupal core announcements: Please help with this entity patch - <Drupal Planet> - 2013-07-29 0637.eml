    <p>Field storage is being converted to be entity based and so fields will no longer be shareable between entity types (sharing between bundles / node types is still allowed). While the system itself is mostly done and working, this broke a lot of tests. Helping hands are much appreciated in <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2047777" title="https://drupal.org/node/2047777">https://drupal.org/node/2047777</a> . chx is available in IRC almost around the clock to help. As this is the very foundation of the entity-field API, we can't freeze other entity APIs before this is done.</p>
