Moreover, how do you get <em>large amounts</em> of data into the system with (relative) ease? And if you've used a content management system before, you've likely faced a similar, albeit inverted problem: <em>how do you get your data out</em>?</p>
<p>If you can accomplish these preliminary items without a good deal of effort, you're finally left with the task of transforming the data from one, and allowing it to be recognizable by the other.</p>
<p>If, instead, you haven't used either of these, you're likely wondering why on Earth you would want to.</p>
<h3>Resource Sharing: Web Ontologies and Eagle-I</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eagle-i.net/">Eagle-I ontology</a> is an open source, web-based software project facilitating a growing network of linked open data.</p>
<p>So let's break that down. Eagle-I is fundamentally a network. The Eagle-I Network was founded by a Consortium of nine academic institutions, and has since grown to <a href="https://www.eagle-i.net/about/participating-institutions/">26 participating institutions</a>. The focus is on the promotion of biomedical resource discovery in the scientific community. So a lab at Harvard University may have a resource that a research scientist needs in Seattle, or vice versa. The cost, of course, is much less for both institutions if the resources can be shared, but only if they know where to look.</p>
