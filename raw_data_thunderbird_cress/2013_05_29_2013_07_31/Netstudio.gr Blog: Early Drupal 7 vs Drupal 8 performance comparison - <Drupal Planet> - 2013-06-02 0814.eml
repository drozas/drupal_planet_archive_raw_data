There are numerous blog posts about it and the new features it has.Â There are hundreds (if not thousands) of issue queues where you can watch our community discuss and build the new system, you can even try the freshest dev release by using <a href="http://simplytest.me" target="_blank">SimplyTest.me</a>.</p>
<p>But, while there is a vast amount of information about Drupal 8, I couldn't find any metrics about how it will compare with Drupal 7 performancewise. I know that we're not in code freeze yet and that performance improvements are scheduled for the "polish phase" which officially starts on 1 July, but I was curious to see how Drupal 8 performs at this stage, where many API's have changed, a lot of hooks have been replaced and a new framework is implemented into it (Symfony2).</p></div></div></div>
