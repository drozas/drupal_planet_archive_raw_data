<p>Why content, not papers? Well, the DrupalCon program has changed since we last did the call. We've listened to feedback from DrupalCon attendees, and we're hoping our new direction will really resonate with our audience. In addition to our regular great offerings of Sessions, BoFs, CXO, Keynotes and Training, we're excited to roll out a few new initiatives. </p></div></div></div>
