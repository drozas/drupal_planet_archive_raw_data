<p>At this point, we have a great tradition of extended sprints around big Drupal events including the ones we did around DrupalCons in Portland, Munich, Denver, as well as Drupal Dev Days like Dublin and Barcelona. While there is a sprint day included in DrupalCons (usually) on Friday, given that a lot of the Drupal core and contrib developers fly in for these events, it makes a lot of sense to use this opportunity to start sooner and/or extend our stay and work together in one space on the harder problems.</p>
<p><a href="http://prague2013.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Prague</a> is next up! This is the first DrupalCon, where the Drupal Association recognises the need for extended sprints as part of the schedule and works with sprinters to provide space on Monday as well! We'd still need to organise any additional sprints before/after for ourselves as needed though. To figure out what kind of space would be needed, it would be amazing if those interested would sign up with their availability, so we'd have an idea.</p>
<p>There is no commitment of space available at this point outside of Monday and Friday, but the Drupal community is powerful enough to make things happen!</p>
