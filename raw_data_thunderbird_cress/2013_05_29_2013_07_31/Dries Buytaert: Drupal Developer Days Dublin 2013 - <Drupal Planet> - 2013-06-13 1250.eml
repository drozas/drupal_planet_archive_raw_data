After such prior locations as Barcelona and Brussels, the <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Developer Days is coming to Dublin</a> this year!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/program/sessions">conference program</a> includes great sessions on security, project management, automation, multilingual, mapping, REST, continuous integration and so on! Lots of opportunities to learn about Drupal and the entry ticket is only â‚¬25.</p>
<p>The event is also ideally timed to coincide with the last days before Drupal 8's API freeze. There is a <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/program/sprints">whole weeklong sprint</a> included for those who want to work on <a href="http://buytaert.net/want-more-features-in-drupal-8-help-fix-bugs">solving major and critical issues</a> as well as any <a href="http://buytaert.net/code-freeze-and-thresholds">patches still viable before API freeze</a>. If you are still to take your first steps to contribute, the <a>Community Tools Workshop</a> is for you to delve into giving back.</p>
<p>There will be a recruitment event there too, so when you register make sure to say that you're looking for a job. Acquia will be there so come talk with us about the work we do if you are interested in joining!</p>
