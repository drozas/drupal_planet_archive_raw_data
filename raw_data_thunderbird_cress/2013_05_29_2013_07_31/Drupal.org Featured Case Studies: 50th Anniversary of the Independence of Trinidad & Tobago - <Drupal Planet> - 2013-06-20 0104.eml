<p>Trinidad and Tobago achieved Independence on August 31st, 1962 and is observed 50 years of Independence in 2012. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago remembered and celebrated this important milestone with a series of fitting initiatives. These aimed to recognize and celebrate some of the important events, people and places that helped shaped the countryâ€™s rich and diverse history. It is within this scope of events that this website was born. The purpose of the website was twofold in that it was to serve as a "one-stop-shop" for all information pertaining to anniversary events in 2012 as well as being a media archive of the celebrations and important moments in our history.</p>
