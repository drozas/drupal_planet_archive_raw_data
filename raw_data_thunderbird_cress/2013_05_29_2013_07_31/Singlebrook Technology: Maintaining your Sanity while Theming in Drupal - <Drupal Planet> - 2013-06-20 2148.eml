</p>
<p>Over the past several months I've spent working on Drupal projects, I've learned that theming these sites can easily become a labyrinth of function overrides, template files, stylesheets, javascripts, imagesâ€”everything but the kitchen sink. </p>

<p>So at Singlebrook, we've come up with a simple way to organize our theming files, and created a base "template" folder for new themes, packaging up the best of SASS, Modernizr, LiveReload, and sane file organization. </p>

<p>Our theme is meant to be a baseline that can be renamed and built upon, rather than a base theme for sub-themes to stem from.  We can simply clone the base theme template repository into our new Drupal site, rename the folder and all theme functions/files, and voila!  Ready to go.  ...
