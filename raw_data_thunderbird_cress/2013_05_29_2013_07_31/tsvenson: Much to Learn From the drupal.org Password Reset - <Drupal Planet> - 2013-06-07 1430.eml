    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>The Drupal Association staff and Drupal community did an amazing and transparent job in handling the recent security breach where user account and personal data got into the wrong hands. However, what haven't been addressed yet is the <em><strong>resulting sitewide password reset</strong></em>. What can we learn from that? How did drupal.org users experience it? What will happen if it would have been another site?</p>
<p>Do we need a sitewide password reset feature in Drupal Core?</p>
<p>That and other things is being discussed in this post, including how the Drupal community can take advantage of this unique opportunity to prepare for the next time it happens.</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-link-to-self-for-rss field-type-link-field field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="http://www.tsvenson.com/blog/2013/06/much-to-learn-from-the-drupalorg-password-reset" title="Much to Learn From the drupal.org Password Reset">Read the full "Much to Learn From the drupal.org Password Reset" post on www.tsvenson.com</a></div></div></div>
