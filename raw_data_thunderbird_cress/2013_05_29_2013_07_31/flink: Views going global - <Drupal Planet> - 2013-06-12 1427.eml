<p>No don't run away yet…. give me a sec… please. </p>
<p>I am well aware that even seasoned site builders fear to tread into that hidden-by-default upper right-hand corner of the Views UI configuration page labelled "Advanced". Most of us have opened it once, seen the heading "Contextual Filters" and gone "Mwaaah… what's that cr@p and what good is it to me?"</p>
<p>Well quite a lot of good, actually. If you can just hang in there, I'll get straight to the point. </p>
<p>You need <em>contextual filters</em> instead of, or in addition to, normal filters when:<br />
1) you want to pass arguments to a View that has no exposed filter UI or that needs its UI bypassed initially, e.g. from links elsewhere on the same or another site, or in an email or newsletter<br />
2) you want to do funky stuff with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels">Panels</a> and the like, which we won't discuss here<br />
3) you want to pass a filter argument to many different Views at once, residing as pages and in blocks, all from a single UI widget, which you can place as a little block anywhere on your site -- the <strong>picked once, operates site-wide</strong> (<strong>POOS</strong>) filter principle.</p>
<p>That last quality facilitates UX enhancements many continue to ask for and for good reason.</p>
<p>Here's a few use-cases:<br />
o a visitors lands anywhere on a site, be it one for real estate, events or travel and enters state, city or postcode of interest; instantly all relevant pages on the site filter on the region entered, without the visitor having to re-enter their selection again, unless they wish to change it<br />
o a user visits an online gift ship, enters maximum spend and... *poofff*... only sees applicable merchandise on any of the pages they visit<br />
o same for date ranges, music genres... any taxonomy terms, any field occurring in more than one View on your site</p>
<p>So how do you give your plain contextual filters the far-ranging wings of point 3) ? <strong>Views Global Filter</strong>, that's how. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/global_filter">Try it</a>. </p>
<p>And if after that you still dislike contextual filters, write to us -- you'd be the first to complain.</p>
<p>                                                                                 * * * </p>
<p>Note re point 1) above: if you want to contextually pass to a View filter ranges, e.g. 50--150, rather than single values, check out <a href="http://drupal.org/project/contextual_range_filter">Views Contextual Range Filter</a></p>
