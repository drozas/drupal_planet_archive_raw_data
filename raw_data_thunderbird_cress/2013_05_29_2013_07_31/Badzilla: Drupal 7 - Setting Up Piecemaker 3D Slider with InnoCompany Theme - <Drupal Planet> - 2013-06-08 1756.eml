             <p>Subsequent to my earlier blog on installing and setting up the commercial InnoCompany Drupal 7 theme, it is now time to do something useful - set up the Piecemaker 3D slider which is based on Flash animation, with an XML configuration file. Thankfully a lot of the work has already been bundled into the InnoCompany theme and there isn't that much to do. Principally the slider images, captions and links are included in theme configuration, and there are 10 available placeholders which means the carousel may have up to 10 images.</p>
