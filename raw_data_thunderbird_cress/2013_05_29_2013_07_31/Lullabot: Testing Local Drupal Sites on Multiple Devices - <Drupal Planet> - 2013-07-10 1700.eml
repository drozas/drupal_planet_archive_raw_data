  <p>Do you develop your websites on your local machine? Do you need to test those sites across multiple devices, and face hassles using them to access the locally-hosted site? Have you tried different methods, processes, workarounds, tutorials, and blog posts about how to connect to your local machine?  If you are like me, then you answer all of these questions with a loud, "yes!"</p>
<h3>Where I started.</h3>
<p>While I was working on a recent project I became mildly obsessed with refining a better system for testing on multiple devices. Let me outline where I started on this journey...</p>
<h3>My goal is to view my local website development on as many displays/devices as possible. </h3>
<ul><li>I use MAMP PRO to manage my sites.</li>
<li>I use a wireless router within my house.</li>
<li>I develop on a Mac, which gives me great access to Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.  With a virtual box I can test Windows with IE7,8,9,10 slowly, but serviceable most of the time.</li>
<li>I have a PC Laptop which I have connected to my local network, which requires me to edit the hosts file, I can then access the the local website development on my Mac.</li>
<li>I have an iPhone and iPad and an Android, and testing on these devices was not easy.  I was constantly changing settings and configurations, altering settings in virtual hosts, using easyDNS, and I was trying different things all the time to get a good stable and easy process.</li>
</ul>
