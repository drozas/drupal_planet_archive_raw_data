    <p>Last week, 17 Forum One developers and strategists joined 3,300 other Drupalers in Portland, Oregon, for <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/">the biggest DrupalCon conference ever</a>. We had a &ldquo;Nodetorious-ly&rdquo; good time, convening with the Drupal community, learning about the future of Drupal, and exploring Portland.</p>

<div dir="ltr">Many of the session <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DrupalAssociation/featured">videos are available online</a>. But to save you time, we&rsquo;ve compiled our top 10 key takeaways from the DrupalCon 2013 conference:</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>1. Drupal 8! Drupal 8! Drupal 8!</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr">It was amazing to see the progress that has been made on Drupal 8 and the direction it is going. Infused in every session, from <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/keynote/dries-buytaert">Dries Buytaert&rsquo;s opening keynote</a>, to the breakouts, to the Birds of a Feather discussions, to the happy hours, was excitement and anticipation for the next major release. While much of the front-end appears the same, nearly everything in the back-end has changed (for the better, in our opinion). Using the new APIs and object-oriented code, we&rsquo;ll be able to accomplish previously difficult changes much more quickly and cleanly. On the administration side, Drupal 8 is making progress as a content distribution tool with digital output services built in. Because Drupal 8 is a far more advanced publishing tool, marketers and web managers will have access to component levels, layouts, and more with Drupal 8.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>2. Know Your Content &amp; Context</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">The future will be filled with more devices in different contexts, outside, inside, on-the-go. As <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/keynote/karen-mcgrane">Karen McGrane talked about in her keynote</a>, it&rsquo;s all about how the content is &ldquo;chunked&rdquo; in ways that we can push it to our multitude of devices in optimized formats and contexts that are relevant to the users. As much as there is talk about mobile, mobile is just one use case, albeit the predominant one now. Who knows what will happen in the next few years? Voice-activated interfaces will get really good? Smart watches? Drupal 8+ is well positioned to take advantage of this future through its flexibility.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>3. Explore Fast, Light Prototyping</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">Through the user experience tracks, we saw that web teams are shifting away from pixel-perfect, static, &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; deliverables to lightweight, easily modifiable deliverables. We&rsquo;ll see more tools for HTML-based, clickable, and interactive experiences over Omnigraffle or Visio wireframes. Speaking of which, Forum One has built a popular interactive prototyping tool for this purpose.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.protytype.com/">Check out Proty</a>.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>4. Drupal Isn&rsquo;t for Everything</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">Obvious? Yes. But we gained a deeper understanding of that statement during the event. It is easy to think of yourself as a &ldquo;Drupal shop&rdquo; and forget that other tools may do things easier and faster. Many of the sessions focused on whether or not Drupal is a CMS or a content publishing tool. Informal break-out conversations and other side conversations focused on NodeJS, REST, WordPress, and other lightweight options that only provide content management and user management frameworks. These were great reminders that Drupal isn't for everything.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>5. More Tools for Multilingual Translations</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">Because many of our clients have an international focus, we learned about the many new tools and modules that aid in building multilingual sites. We&rsquo;ve built many multilingual sites, and shed some blood and tears in the process. Thankfully, many more tools are emerging to make the job easier. A great session on multilingual in Drupal 7 pointed me to a <a href="http://www.kristen.org/d7-i18n">bevy of Drupal modules</a> that make the process a lot easier and more user-friendly.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>6. Know Your Content Strategy</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">Several sessions mentioned NPR&rsquo;s COPE (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zachbrand/npr-api-create-once-publish-everywhere">Create Once Publish Everywhere</a>) strategy. It&rsquo;s again about making content publishing future-proof and device-accessible. Drupal&rsquo;s future will look like a system that allows site-builders to model all different types of content, users, and context. Representing these three things accurately will allow organizations to serve their content to the right people, in the right way, at the right time. Creating websites/pages will always be a core &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of Drupal, and most people will probably just use it to do that, but those who understand content strategy will really be able to harness Drupal&rsquo;s abilities in a powerful way.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>7. Drupal 8 Will Be Object-Oriented</strong></div>
<p>Drupal 8 represents the single largest change to the code-base ever, restructuring Drupal to use object-oriented practices. This will change the project entirely moving forward. Although this is a programming change, the outcome will be sites that perform better and have shorter development cycles. Using more sophisticated design patterns, developers can more cleanly extend almost any part of the system without having to duplicate functionality. As we continue down this path, we foresee Drupal becoming more modular to allow the system to function more efficiently based on the types of requests being made, rather than loading the entire code-base into memory for even basic JSON requests.&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>8. Drupal 8 Will Be More Accessible</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr">Major improvements are coming in Drupal 8 for accessibility. In a perfect world, websites would be just as accessible by sound as they are by sight. Drupal takes us part of the way there with some new amazing tools. The foundational HTML markup is being expanded into APIs that make it easy to express the state of page components, not just their properties. They will be available in contrib and some in core as well.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>9. Drush 6 Will Be (Even) Easier for Standard Tasks</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">Drush 6, a command line shell and scripting interface for Drupal 8, is going to really help developers execute complex or repetitive tasks. New features in Drush will allow developers to edit views and other configuration directly through Drush. In addition, many standard tasks, such as setting up test environments, will be quicker and less costly. These updates will make developers happier and reduce the time (and costs) for many activities.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>10. A More REST-ful Drupal Will Lead to More Data Sharing</strong><br />
Drupal 8 will ship with a <a href="http://buytaert.net/the-future-is-a-restful-drupal">powerful REST-ful interface</a>. REST, which stands for representational state transfer, is a predominant method for enabling programmers to move content between sites and services. Making Drupal more &ldquo;REST-ful&rdquo; is huge, as it will allow sitebuilders to expose any Drupal data they&rsquo;d like onto web apps, mobile apps, and any other device that can consume RESTful data over the internet. Drupal 8 will help push Drupal from being just a simple CMS that pushes HTML to a browser to a powerful platform that can push data to interactive web apps and mobile apps. Organizations with interesting data stored and managed in Drupal can more easily share that data to today&rsquo;s devices and applications, as well as to those that haven&rsquo;t been invented yet!</div>
