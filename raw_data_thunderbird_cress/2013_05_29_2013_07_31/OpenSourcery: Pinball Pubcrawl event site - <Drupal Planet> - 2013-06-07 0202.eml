<p>If you were at DrupalCon Portland, you may have heard about OpenSourcery's Pinball Pubcrawl party. A week before the party, I was reminded of an idea I've had for the last couple years, which actually originated at DrupalCon Chicago during a module-building contest. The idea is a central hub where you can see who in the larger party has checked in at which places. People are commonly spread out throughout the same square mile surrounding the conference center at various bars and restaurants. With this new project, <a href="https://github.com/jessehs/fourdrop">Fourdrop</a>, users can check in at their current or future location (locations are created by event coordinators), and discover other places, and see who is there, or on the way there.</p>
