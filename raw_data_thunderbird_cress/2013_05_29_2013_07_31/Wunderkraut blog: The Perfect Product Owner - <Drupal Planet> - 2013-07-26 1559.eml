    In my experience the most important person in an agile project team is the product owner. Having a great product owner makes a big difference on how successful the project is.  </p>
<div class="field-ns-blog-post-body clearfix">
            <div class="field-item even"> <h2>What is a product owner</h2><div>Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Roles">sums it up</a>: <em>"The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and is the voice of the customer. He or she is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The Product Owner writes (or has the team write) customer-centric items (typically user stories), ranks and prioritises them, and adds them to the product backlog. Scrum teams should have one Product Owner, and while they may also be a member of the development team, this role should not be combined with that of the Scrum Master. In an enterprise environment, though, the Product Owner is often combined with the role of Project Manager as they have the best visibility regarding the scope of work (products)."</em></div><div> </div><div>In a large organisation there are typically two different roles: <strong>Product owner</strong> and <strong>product sponsor</strong>. For example in a web project the product owner would typically be a marketing manager responsible for the related web activities. The product sponsor in this case would be the chief marketing officer. The sponsor typically approves the high level budget and goals for a project, but is not involved on daily basis. The product owner on the other hand is very much involved every day.</div><div> </div><h2><img alt="product-owner-characteristics.png" class="media-image" height="270" style="width: 480px; height: 270px; margin: 5px;" title="product-owner-characteristics.png" width="480" src="http://wunderkraut.com/sites/wunderkraut.com/files/styles/large/public/product-owner-characteristics.png?itok=PQcK4vJQ" /></h2><div> </div><h3>Authority</h3><div>There are thousands of decisions to do in any project ranging from approving small details to setting priorities for different business goals. The product owner has to be able to decide on these. For some very large changes approval from the sponsor or somebody else in the organisation may be required, but for the most part the product owner has to have the authority to decide.</div><div> </div><div>The product owner is not a traditional project manager position making sure that fixed requirements are fulfilled in fixed schedule and budget. The product owner has to be able to make decisions about the project just in time and these decisions have a very large impact on the project end results.</div><div> </div><h3>Availability</h3><div>The product owner position takes time. A lot of time. In a fast moving project the PO may become the bottleneck where tasks are waiting for her feedback or decisions. Depending on the velocity of a project the product owner should be able to work almost full time for the project.</div><div> </div><div>Often organisations new to agile are overly optimistic on how much time is required from them during a project. With productive modern tools tight schedules on IT projects may often be less challenging for the team than the product owner.</div><div> </div><h3>Knowledge</h3><div>Naturally it's not enough to just make decisions during a project, they also have to be informed decisions. Because of this the product owner should be an expert on the subject of the project. It's perfectly ok to ask help from other experts on complex decisions but as with authority there should be enough knowledge for most daily decisions to keep things moving forward.</div><div> </div><div>Expert level knowledge is also very important to support the team members. The team members will in most cases ask difficult questions from the product owner every day during a project. Wide and deep enough knowledge is also a must have in order for the product owner to prioritise all project stories.</div><h2>Supporting a product owner</h2><div>In real life there are very few perfect product owners. Typically the ones that would be ideal otherwise don't have enough time for the position. Because of this it's important to have enough support in place for the product owner.</div><div> </div><div>For a new product owner, it's important to provide training and support. It's a standard mode of operations for us to provide product owner training for new customers that don't have extensive agile experience. This helps a lot in getting started with agile concepts and tools.</div><div> </div><div>Having a solid steering framework is a must for any agile project. This framework is there for business level quality assurance, in other words to make sure the project is creating value and aligning all stakeholders behind common goals. Project steering is a large topic that I will cover on another blog post.</div><div> </div><div>Project team should organise frequent sprint demos for all stakeholders. These ensure that the team can get early feedback, new ideas outside of the team and set the right expectations for stakeholders. Demo early, demo often is a good mantra for any project.</div><div> </div><div>Last but not least when a product owner doesn't have sufficient availability we can use a product owner buddy. This means including a senior consultant with relevant industry experience in the project team. The role of this consultant is to help the product owner to prioritise the stories, answer the questions of the team, help to set definitions of done and be the right hand for the product owner in general. As an added benefit the consultant will naturally bring in external expertise to the project.</div> </div>
