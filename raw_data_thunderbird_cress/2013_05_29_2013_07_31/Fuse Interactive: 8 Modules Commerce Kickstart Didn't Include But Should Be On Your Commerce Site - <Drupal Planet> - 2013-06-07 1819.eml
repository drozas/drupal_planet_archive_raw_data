We've been using <a href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart">Commerce Kickstart</a> as the base for some projects and customize to meet client business requirements. By using Kickstart, we no longer need to download a long list of modules and configure them individually, it saves us many hours of work and save money for our clients. For users that are new to <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, and want to have an online store, Commerce Kickstart is great.</p></div></div></div>
