I asked thirty people at <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Dev Days in Dublin</a> what they are excited about, and put together a video with them saying what that is. We got a very wide range of answers, from whole initiatives such as multilingual and configuration management, to individual features such as inline editing or form modes; and then some goodies for developers such as the use of Symfony, testable code, and the use of Twig.</p>

<p>You can see the answers in my video on the <a href="https://youtube.com/commpress">comm-press YouTube channel</a>, or in more detail in the captions to <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/105339698846668805916/albums/5895037456147452961">this photo album on Google+</a>. We got a good amount of resonance thanks to the community's interest and their help in sharing the video via their own Twitter accounts, as well as in IRC. At the time of writing, we've got over 800 views for the video.</p>
