Though this isn’t my first planning round for a Con, it is my first real opportunity to work on the “official” planning team, and the times they are a-changing! We have spent lots of time on brainstorming changes to improve DrupalCon. We’re hoping to remove some of what hasn’t been working so well and try out some new ideas. Now that the community has been running European DrupalCons and camps for around 10 years, we’re hoping that the time is ripe for innovations like the DRUPAL LABS!</p></div></div></div>
