Although I did do live demos at previous editions of this session, at this point we have just too many great improvements, that it does not fit anymore. So for this session, I opted to provide a better overview and more context as to how this affects site building in general for Drupal 8, including the extent of change as it applies to contributed modules.</p>
<p>We are still working on several key pieces of the initiative, and will have meetings every Wednesday leading up to the code freeze coming July 1st, 2013. <a href="http://www.drupal8multilingual.org/events">Join on our meetings</a> to help with the remaining tasks. We have tasks for all experience levels!</p>
