                 	<p>In the Drupal Community it’s all about showing up. Join in on your local users group, contribute code, participate in conferences, present sessions – be involved. That’s what we did this past week at <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org">DrupalCon Portland</a>. In the spirit of <a href="http://imagexmedia.com/about?qt-about_us_tabs=2">Always Evolving</a> we sent sixteen team members, from our <span class="caps">CEO</span> Glenn to our intern Colin, to take part in the learning festivities of the biggest DrupalCon yet. </p>        </div>
