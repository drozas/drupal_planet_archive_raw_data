I wanted some of that goodness now, so I've just updated the theme here to <a href="https://drupal.org/project/responsive_bartik">Responsive Bartik</a> so it's now mobile friendly.</p>

<p>Magic - that's what this feels like.&nbsp; I did nothing but install a new theme. Drupal - and the extraordinary community behind it made this happen.</p>
<p>The amazing <a href="http://jensimmons.com/">Jen Simmons</a> created <a href="https://drupal.org/project/bartik">Bartik</a>, with contributions from John Albin and Jacine.&nbsp; The responsive version for D7 was largely built by <a href="http://mjohnq3.github.io/blog/2013/06/13/responsive-bartik/">John Quinn</a> who also had <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1733752/committers">help from others</a>.&nbsp; I'm sure there are countless more people who have been involved in tracking, testing and patching issues for this. Kudos to all of you. And Thank You.</p>
