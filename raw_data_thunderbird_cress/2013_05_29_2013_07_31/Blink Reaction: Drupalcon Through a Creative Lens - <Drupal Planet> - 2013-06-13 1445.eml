I come from advertising. This was my first Drupalcon. I was attending on a severely sprained ankle and had left my fianc√© (now wife) at home just two weeks before our wedding. Needless to say on my shaky flight to a city that is stuck with a perpetual rain cloud over it, my mind was not focused on Drupal.</p></div></div></div>
