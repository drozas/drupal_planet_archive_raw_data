I took detailed notes for (most of) the sessions I attended. Here are the ones that were good enough to share with the internet. They also link to their session pages, where a lot of the videos have been posted.</p>
<p>For more information, and for session videos, check out the official <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/">DrupalCon 2013 website</a>.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13uIzDCeh5MnMdvLYefxBnCR6C5TKUy8-w1U9kVvjI7w/edit?usp=sharing">Secrets to Awesomizing Your Editor's Back-End Drupal Experience</a>: If I'd only gone to one session, I'd have wanted it to be this one. Mike showed a variety of modules that make an editor's job a little easier. If you want editor buy-in on your Drupal site, that's a huge deal. Presented by @mikeherchel.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XFxWM92HRnylShcIV-IIfjpcvhoAPUeb3dulqND3GQ/edit?usp=sharing">Making Sense of the Numbers: DOs and DON'Ts of Quality Performance Testing</a>: This session covered the terms people throw around with performance testing, who has responsibility for good site performance (spoiler: it's everyone), and straightforward dos and don'ts that help you get usable data out of your performance testing. Presented by @erikwebb and @doogiemac.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAMuKTCJLQ5QItNtSeWdewykvm6nPD7yFVkW2YxgYuo/edit?usp=sharing">What's New in Drush 6</a>: I love this session for showing me how to upload my module list to Google Docs, as a spreadsheet, with ONE COMMAND. Presented by @weitzman, @msonnabaum, @jhedstro, and @grugnog.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cdP6nPaFojXrbFbTZJnTofjZkARzkhj0aa3vZNoeBqY/edit?usp=sharing">Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS</a>: You know that sinking feeling you get when you look at a 4,000 line CSS file and wonder how it happened? This will help you avoid that feeling. Presented by @snookca.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vii5E8BJTWS1ZLii_CbOxrM18Kp9vRyjppHlKyM3ThA/edit?usp=sharing">Multilingual Module Madness: What i18n Modules Do You Really Need?</a>: There are lots of multilingual modules out there. There's no perfect way to know which ones you need (other than a lot of experience), but the aim of this session was to give you a starting point based on your project's requirements. Presented by @kristen_pol.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZI1uFoA5GaWTgX9V8medNMgBkTQCoX6AYQnOjzGofso/edit?usp=sharing">What Developers Need to Know About Dev Ops</a>: My notes on this are more haphazard than I'd like, but this session on what developers need to know about the environment their site will live in had great information -- like sample differences between a dev box and a production box, and a list of common pitfalls when you develop without understanding your production environment. Presented by @gchaix, @ramereth, @KenLett, and @basic_.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yoew-imR29RD9vqbxU4d5l_9JR2ziwk-QoI1LNJNFrY/edit?usp=sharing">Should Have Made a Left Turn at Albuquerque: Building Maps in Drupal</a> - These are really limited notes. I normally wouldn't share them, but there were two fantastic mini-sessions: one gave a "recipe" for building great maps in Drupal, and the other showed impressive interactivity features with D3js.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vslXPn-vcTjka2iXTfXe4GvQJXk5rNZofL7l3ZR6r4/edit?usp=sharing">Rules Without the UI</a>: This was a very detailed session, with lots of code examples, showing you how to set up rules in your module's code. Presented by @dwkitchen.</li>
