    <p>During the week June 24th a mass of Drupal folks will converge on Dublin, Ireland for <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Dev Days</a>. This year, in addition to the three days of DrupalCamp that is happening (June 28-30), there is also a <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/program/sprints">week of sprints</a> leading up to the camp, and to the Drupal 8 code freeze deadline. This is it. If it's going to be in Drupal 8, it needs to happen before the end of June.</p>
