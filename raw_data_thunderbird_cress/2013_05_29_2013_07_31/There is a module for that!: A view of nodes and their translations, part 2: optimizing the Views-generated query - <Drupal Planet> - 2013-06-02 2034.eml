    <p><a href="view-nodes-and-their-translations">Last week, I described a technique to query and display nodes in all available translations</a>. This worked well enough, but a performance-minded reader pointed out that the query generated by Views (that includes N self-joins for N enabled languages) would not scale to a large number of nodes.</p>

<p>My usual approach when implementing new ideas is to ensure the logic works first, and only handle optimization when needed. It's a strategy that has worked well for me in the past. So I set out to test this hypothesis, and to optimize the query if it was needed.</p>
