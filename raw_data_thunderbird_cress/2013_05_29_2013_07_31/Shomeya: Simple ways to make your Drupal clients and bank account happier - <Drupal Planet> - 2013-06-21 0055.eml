Wish you could do more than break even? Tired of feeling like you jumped into the deep end of the pool every time there&#39;s a Drupal upgrade? Here are some simple ways to make Drupal consulting fun again.</p>

<h3>1. Listen to what your clients are actually asking for</h3>

<p>Say your client wants to have a block that they can put &#39;anything&#39; into. Obviously Drupal data is in many forms, views, content types, nodes, beans, entities...it&#39;s not that simple especially for non-technical client&#39;s. (See Mike&#39;s upcoming book <a href="http://modelyourdatawithdrupal.com">Model Your Data with Drupal</a> for more info on how to keep Drupal&#39;s data structures nice and tidy.)</p>

<p>Stop and ask yourself what is it that the client really needs?</p>
