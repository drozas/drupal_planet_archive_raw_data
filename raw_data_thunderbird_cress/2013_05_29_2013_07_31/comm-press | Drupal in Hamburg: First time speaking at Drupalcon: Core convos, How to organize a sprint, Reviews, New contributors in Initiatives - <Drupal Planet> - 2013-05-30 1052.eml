<p>The first time I spoke into a microphone at Drupalcon Portland was during the conversation part of the Core conversation: <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3863">Making core development sustainable</a> by Greg Dunlap. I had so much adrenalin, I was shaking. I took notes while waiting in line for the mic, so I had a bit I wanted to say. :) That was also the session where the Developer Revolt was said out-loud: that developers, since they are in demand, can insist that they only work for companies that give them X number of hours to work on contributing to Drupal. I suggest that X equals at least 3 hours per week.</p>

<p>The problem with that is that even experienced drupalers can use help picking issues to work on. So having support to help developers use their community hours well is important. I have some ideas about how to put that into practice, so I'll be reporting on how that goes later in the summer as I experiment on some of my fellow comm-press folks.</p>

<h3>Plan a sprint in your hometown</h3>

<p>My main session can be watched now for anyone who is thinking about organizing a sprint in their hometown. At portland, we had about 350 people at the mentored sprint and about another 250 in the regular sprint... but the <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/2433">Running coaches wanted! Contribution sprints and trainings</a> session by Jess, Andrea, Addi and me, has info useful for any size sprint, 8 participants and on up! I'm super happy this was recorded so that people can watch it anytime and see that they themselves can do a sprint. Also, it forced us to organize documentation we already had into a clearer document on drupal.org: <a href="https://drupal.org/core-mentoring/sprint-resources">Sprint Resources</a>. One of the things we took to heart from the optional speaker webinars was to make our session accessible. So if anyone has feedback on how we did in that area, I'd like to hear about it.</p>

<h3>Passionate about needs tags? Yep.</h3>

<p><a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3903">Patch Reviews: Get good reviews, give good reviews. Faster.</a> by Andrea Soper and me, I think, gave me a chance to speak passionately. I got to propose crazy suggestions for the future, and I took notes of suggestions that people had. One super outcome of this session was that it might actually be possible to do one of the crazy suggestions which is to have a check list of remaining tasks, that will automatically link to instructions (<a href="https://drupal.org/new-contributors">Contributor task documents</a>). Talking with folks, it seems like a timeline for a checklist of needs, is at least 3 months, and after the Drupal 7 port of Drupal.org. Another good suggestion was to have a sidebar block that highlights if a patch is one of the first couple produced by a new person.</p>

<h3>Missing target audience, no problem. New contributors in core initiatives.</h3>

<p><a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3833">New Contributors and Core Initiatives: What they bring and how to bring them in</a> by Jess and me, was given to a target audience: Core Initiative Leads, who ... had scheduling conflicts and were not able to attend. The audience that was there was great. :) But, since the core conversations were recorded, I will be checking in with some of my IO friends to see if they watched it. ;)</p>
