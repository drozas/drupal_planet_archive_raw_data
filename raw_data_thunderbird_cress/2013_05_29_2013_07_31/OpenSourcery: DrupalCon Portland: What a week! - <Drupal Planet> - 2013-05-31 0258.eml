    <p>One week ago today, DrupalCon Portland concluded.</p>
<p>While the weather didn't completely cooperate (it's still cloudy, cold, &amp; misting BTW), the overall atmosphere was polite, the keynotes were interesting, the sessions were varied and the attendance was record setting. I feel like I learned a ton.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.5;">Here's a short list of some of my favorite sessions:</span></p>
<p>Anthony Ferara's session on code complexity was instructive, delightful and inspiring. I spoke with another dev about it and we both started geeking out on the tools he was using. Phploc in particular was something I could easily get using in short order.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Michael Lopp's keynote was thought provoking, and focused. He spoke on the three archetypes critical for the success of a startup, the engineer, the designer, and the dictator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">The old &amp; new field API in D8 session was another crazy mind expanding session that incorporated much of the new D8 hotness. For example it was reported that field instances are now CMI compliant, work on field widgets and display settings are in the works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Ryan Weaver’s Behat session was splashy, inspiring, and raucous. It covered how Behavior Driven Development has the possibility to convert user stories into tests that can be executed as QA steps. </span></p>
<h4>The Takeaway</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">What was truly memorable was the sheer scale of DrupalCon. With 3300 recorded attendees, the logistics of coordinating all the speakers, the food, coffee and extra time activities was staggering. The continued growth of the Drupal Community at times can be hard to quantify, but when you’re standing shoulder to shoulder with 3000+ drupaleros for a group photo, the exhilaration is palpable. What’s even more impressive is that not long ago, DrupalCon North America could have fit inside of one of the smaller conference rooms with space to spare. The sprints on Friday alone had higher attendance than several early DrupalCons, as claimed by chx.</span></p>

<script async="" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>All in all, it was an exciting week and a productive one at that.</p>
<p>DrupalCon Portland produced numberless new connections and strengthened friendships, a FEMA affiliated disaster logistics site in under 24 hours supporting victims of the tornado in Oklahoma, committing twig support into Drupal core, and completely swamping the testing servers for core patches.</p>
<p>For a short, rainy week, it was good work, good work indeed. All of this stems from a central Drupal truism: <em>our strength is in our community</em>. Codebase is one effect of that strength.</p>
