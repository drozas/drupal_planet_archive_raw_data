    <p>The Drupal 8 <a href="https://drupal.org/core/release-cycle#polish-phase">code freeze deadline</a> is quickly approaching, which means that time is running out to make <a href="https://drupal.org/core/release-cycle#api_change">API changes</a>. After the code freeze deadline, we enter Drupal 8's <em>polish phase</em> -- the home stretch of Drupal 8 development where we will focusing on fixing bugs and moving Drupal 8 toward the first release candidate later this year.</p>
<p>This means that we need your help to get the word out there about Drupal 8! Help the community get ready for Drupal 8 by talking about it at your local user groups, meetups, and camps. Pick a Drupal 8 topic that you're excited about, or try presenting on one of these topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Drupal 8: What you need to know</h3>
<p><a href="https://drupal.org/user/24967">webchick</a> put together a great slide deck all about <a href="https://drupal.org/sandbox/xjm/2012090">everything you should know about Drupal 8</a>. Anyone is welcome to use, share, and update this presentation. It was last updated in April, so it should be <em>mostly</em> accurate, and <a href="https://drupal.org/user/107403">swentel</a> has also created an <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bL_WOqGcWdUrMI16qDPKi_3boxlf2jaDRo-_DTg7CT4/edit#slide=id.gdeab7182_1180">updated version in a Google doc</a>. Post issues in the sandbox queue to help us keep it up to date. </p>

<h3>Upgrading your modules to Drupal 8</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/pants">Pants module</a> provides a tutorial for upgrading contributed modules from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. The tutorial was originally created by <a href="https://drupal.org/user/24967">webchick</a> for <a href="http://sydney2013.drupal.org/program/core-conversations" title="Session on upgrading modules to D8 at DrupalCon Sydney">DrupalCon Sydney</a>, and <a href="https://drupal.org/user/78040">effulgentsia</a> presented an updated version as a live demo at <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/upgrading-your-modules-drupal-8" title="Session on upgrading modules to D8 at DrupalCon Portland">DrupalCon Portland</a>. If you're interested in presenting this as a session, effulgentsia can help you prepare the tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about either presentation, or if you notice anything that needs to be updated, contact <a href="https://drupal.org/user/65776">xjm</a> or <a href="https://drupal.org/user/78040">effulgentsia</a>. And, if you <em>do</em> plan on presenting on one of these topics, please let us know! We're keeping track of which camps already have sessions on these topics. The goal is to cover these topics at <strong>every Drupal camp until DrupalCon Prague</strong>.</p>
<h3>Drupal Developer Days Dublin</h3>
<p><a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Developer Days Dublin</a> is just a few weeks away, and is a great opportunity to talk about Drupal 8 or get involved! The <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/news/deadline-session-proposals-extended">session submission deadline</a> was just extended to June 7, so there's still <strong>a couple more days to submit a session</strong>. We're looking for speakers who are interested in presenting either the Drupal 8 overview or the module upgrade tutorial. (xjm has already <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/program/sessions/upgrading-your-modules-drupal-8">submitted a proposal</a> for someone to give the module upgrade presentation, so please get in touch if you'd like to help.) Or, submit your own awesome topic!</p>
<p>Finally, don't miss the <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/program/sprints">sprints</a> leading up to the event (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aqxsrc5BVkagdHdGdzhCdlRMVHFQbHl3RlhlRWhEZFE#gid=0<br />
">signup spreadsheet</a>). If you're new to sprints or to Drupal 8 contribution, check out the <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/program/community-tools-workshop">Community Tools Workshop</a>, which will get you set up with everything you need to work on Drupal 8 core or on porting contributed modules.</p>
