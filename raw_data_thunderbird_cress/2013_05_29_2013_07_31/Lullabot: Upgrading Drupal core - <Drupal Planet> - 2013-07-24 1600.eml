  <p>The Drupal core team releases new versions of Drupal frequently. These can contain bug fixes, security patches, or both (sometimes, they even break the law and add new features). Keeping your websites up to date will ensure your users do not see unexpected errors produced by core, and helps prevent hackers from hijacking your site.</p>
<p>Upgrading Drupal core in a live website with a few contributed modules is a pretty straightforward process. Doing it in a website with custom modules, large amounts of data, and custom business logic is no easy task. Patience and meticulousness are your best friends in this endeavor. Every website is different and most probably you will need to perform additional tasks when upgrading your Drupal site.</p>
<p>At Lullabot we have come to a list of common steps which act as a guideline to reduce risks.</p>
