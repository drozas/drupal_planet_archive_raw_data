Let’s take a look at the success we’ve had so far.</p>
<p>Sprinters started arriving early on Monday morning and by the end of the first day the two sprint rooms were almost full. </p>

<p>A third sprint room had to be added to the roster on Wednesday as we were out of space on Tuesday evening. To give you a good idea on numbers the total number of sprinters so far is over 150!</p>
<p>There’s a great vibe in the sprint rooms. Everyone has been saying how well organised the sprints are. Everyone’s enthusiasm to work on Drupal is sky high.</p>

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>The number of core commits this week so far has passed the 90, and it’s going up at a speedy rate. Many thanks to Webchick, AlexPott, and Catch who have been working around the clock to commit everyone's hard work.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights of the week so far:</p>
<ul><li>The Frontend sprint needed to mass relocate as so many people turned up. They are now in a bigger location taking up half a sprint room.</li>
<li>The Beta Blocker Bunnies working hard to reach the Beta release of Drupal 8.</li>
