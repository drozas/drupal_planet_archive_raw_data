    <p>The monthly Drupal core bug fix release window is scheduled for this Wednesday. The last Drupal 7 bug fix release was three months ago, but there haven't been enough changes to the development version since then to warrant a new release.  As a result, there won't be a Drupal 7 bug fix release this month.  A bug fix release next month (in May) is likely.</p>
<p>Upcoming release windows include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, April 16 (security release window)</li>
<li>Wednesday, May 7 (bug fix release window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on Drupal core release windows, see the documentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info#when">release timing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173280">security releases</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/260803">discussion</a> that led to this policy being implemented.</p>
