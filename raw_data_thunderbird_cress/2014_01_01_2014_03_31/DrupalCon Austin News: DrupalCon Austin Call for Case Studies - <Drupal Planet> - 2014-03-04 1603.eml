This is the artist formerly known as the Higher Ed, Non-Profit, and Government Track. We think that boiling this track down to the heart of the matter -- case studies-- is a smart move that also opens up submissions from media and corporate projects.</p>
<p>Please consider submitting a case study before the deadline of March 7th!!</p></div></div></div>
