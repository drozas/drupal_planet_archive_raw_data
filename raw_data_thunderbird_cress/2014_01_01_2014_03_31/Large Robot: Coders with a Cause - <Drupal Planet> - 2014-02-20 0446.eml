    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Next month I'll be co-presenting at a conference for non-profits on the <a href="https://droplabs.net/programs/coders-with-a-cause">Coders with a Cause</a> program we started at Droplabs, the coworking space and computer lab I co-founded in 2011. One of the subjects is on "community barn raisings" and how we work to harness the good will and technical expertise of our software developer community to aid non-profits who are in need of those resources.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with the "barn raising" term, I'll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>This presentation is just one session among many at the conference, but it's on a topic that's very close to my heart. I'd like for this presentation to cover as much as possible within its allotted time and I'm requesting input, ideas, questions — and even answers from everyone reading this — to make the session the best it can be. </p>
<p>Here are some of my questions to you:</p>
<ul><li>Have you taken part in a "barn raising" event in your community? If so, what were the high points for you?
</li><li>Just as important, what were your low points and why? Be as specific as you'd like. There's no need to name names (unless it's your own!)
</li><li>If you haven't had a barn raising for your organization yet, what are the greatest challenges you see preventing you and your organization from doing one?
</li></ul><p>I'd love to have your insights and feedback in the comments below.</p>
<p>Here's the description from our session page at <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/session/community-barn-raisings-drupal-for-good-in-action">https://gladcamp.org/2014/session/community-barn-raisings-drupal-for-goo...</a>  </p>
<blockquote><p>
In this presentation, we will introduce the "barn raising" concept and how our <a href="https://droplabs.net/programs/coders-with-a-cause">Coders with a Cause</a> program has adapted it for website development to benefit non-profits and for-good startups in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>We'd love to see more groups produce barn raising events and we will detail our recipe and recommendations for how to run this style of "code sprint" and harness the technical skills and good will of the Drupal and open source communities for working with non-profits using Drupal.</p>
<p>At our barn raising events, a team of organizers and volunteers work together to build a website from scratch or develop new features to include much needed functionality, design, and other work required by the organization. Barn raisings are teach-and-learn opportunities for our local developer community and each event is a win-win-win for everyone.</p>
<p>Topics we will cover include:</p>
<ul><li>What's a barn raising? Traditional definitions vs. today's digital world;</li>
<li>Giving senior developers opportunities to teach what they know and to become mentors and trainers in their community;</li>
<li>Teaching new developers and boosting everyone's professional career in web development and volunteerism;</li>
<li>How to overcome obstacles and identify challenges before they happen;</li>
<li>Incorporating web development best practices, including:
<ul><li>Requirements gathering from stakeholders;</li>
<li>Standups, sprint planning and other Agile development methodologies;</li>
<li>Version control and team-based collaboration;</li>
<li>Ticketing systems and documentation;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Creative ways that you might not expect for staying focused, organized and motivated;</li>
<li>… and having a great time during an intense 1- or 2-day event!</li>
</ul><p>Lee Vodra and Christefano Reyes have organized dozens of barn raisings for non-profits including <a href="http://surfcorps.org">SurfCorps.org</a>, <a href="http://arroyoseco.timebanks.org">TimeBanks USA</a>, the <a href="http://veniceskatepark.com">Venice Skate Park</a> and the <a href="http://arroyoseco.timebanks.org">Arroyo Seco Time Bank</a>; and for-good community projects including <a href="https://droplabs.net">Droplabs.net</a>, <a href="http://onedaycareer.org">OneDayCareer.org</a>, the <a href="http://www.socallinuxepo.com">Southern California Linux Expo</a>, and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/otto">OTTO</a>, a classroom management system.
