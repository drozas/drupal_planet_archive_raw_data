    <p>As you might've heard, <a href="drupal.org/sandbox/chx/2105305">migrate</a> is my last core work -- once migrate is done, I am finished with core development. Meanwhile, I will not participate in any other core issue except those blocking migrate (and <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2068325">the entity query conversion meta</a>). As I have been doing core work for a long time, I am sure there are a few questions. Let me quickly go over them:</p>
<h4>Is this a sign of Drupal in crisis?</h4>
<p>Absolutely not. Drupal is stronger than ever -- my disagreements and the unacceptable manner in which I have expressed them drained contributors and has driven some away. My contributions are no longer useful enough to counter this, by far. I was not working on beta blockers lately so likely the release won't slip because of this.</p>
<h4>Are you gone completely?</h4>
<p>I have taken a break from core work before but by now my vision of Drupal differs from others' not just in technical matters but also in decision-making processes and the future of the community. So yes, I will not participate in core development for a long while, likely forever. However, I will still attend DrupalSouth, Dev Days at Szeged and the camp in New York -- these are necessary to finish Migrate. I will come to DrupalCon Amsterdam -- however, DrupalCon Austin doesn't seem likely at this point. I will still use Drupal. Likely maintain a contrib module or two. I'll be on IRC, on smaller channels, like #drupal-migrate in case you need to ask something. And my email, the contact tab, etc. won't stop working.</p>
<h4>What about stepping down considerately?</h4>
<p>I have dropped all elevated roles I had on drupal.org, groups.drupal.org and qa.drupal.org. The <a href="https://drupal.org/dcoc">Drupal Code of Conduct</a> asks that those stepping down "take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off" --  Others have been working on everything I've participated in in D8. There's no issue that is bottlenecked by me, and I don't foresee any disruption to the project. And again, I am not dropping off the face of the Earth -- please, ask away as necessary.</p>
