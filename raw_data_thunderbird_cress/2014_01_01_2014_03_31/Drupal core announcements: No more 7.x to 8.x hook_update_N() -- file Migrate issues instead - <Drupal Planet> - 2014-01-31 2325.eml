    <p>At DrupalCon Prague, we decided not to provide a Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 upgrade path using the database update system, and to instead provide data migration using a <a href="https://www.acquia.com/blog/d8migrate">Drupal 8 data migration API</a> based on the Migrate module. As of today, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2186315">Drupal 7 sites can no longer be upgraded to Drupal 8 with update.php</a>, and all implementations of <code>hook_update_N()</code> have been <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2168011">removed from Drupal 8 core</a>.</p>
<p>Going forward, <code>hook_update_N()</code> should only be included to provide 8.x to 8.x updates, once the 8.x to 8.x upgrade path is supported.</p>
<p><strong>If your patch introduces a data model change</strong> that would previously have required a <code>hook_update_N()</code> implementation, consider instead whether a new / changed <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2127611">data migration</a> is needed. Migration works by calling APIs, so most changes (for example entities) are covered already. But if your data change is not covered by an API (like changing a raw configuration object name or key) then you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/add/project-issue/drupal">Create a new issue</a> in the Migrate component.</li>
<li>Document the data model change in the issue and reference the core issue that introduces it under the "related issues" section.</li>
<li>Update the summary of your main issue to indicate that the data model change has a corresponding Migrate issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are unsure whether new migration code is needed, file the issue anyway, and Migrate maintainers will review it and close it if it is not needed.
