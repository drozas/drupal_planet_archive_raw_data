This meeting will be the first to use the metrics we developed in our 2014 Leadership Plan to tell the story of our progress. For 2014, each staff update will contain metrics through the prior month. For example, in February, we will be able to report the number of comments in issues on Drupal.org as of 31 January, 2014.</p></div></div></div>
