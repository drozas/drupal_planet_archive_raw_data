    <p>The <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/drupalorg-working-groups/software">Drupal.org Software Working Group</a> is looking for volunteers to take on leadership roles and help guide development of the Drupal.org Community Tools, which include Forums, Drupal Planet, User Groups (groups.drupal.org), User Profiles, User Dashboard.</p>
<p>Basically, this team is about all the tools community uses for things other than code development. Historically all these tools were separate from each other and there was no clear vision or single roadmap/plan. We hope that by improving the decision making structure we can expedite development of these tools and ensure they meet community needs.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/402653/">current proposal</a> for the scope, roles, responsibilities and authority of the team.<br />
For the full background see <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/400478">this post</a>.</p>
<p>The Software Working Group will appoint the new team by the end of February, 2014. Right now we are looking for candidates for the roles on the team. Interested? Know someone who you think would be a great candidate? <a href="https://drupal.org/user/999848/contact">Let us know by February 20!</a></p>
