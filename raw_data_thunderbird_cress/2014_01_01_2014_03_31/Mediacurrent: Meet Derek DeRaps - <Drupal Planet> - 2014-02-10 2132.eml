<p dir="ltr"><strong><br />1. What's your role at Mediacurrent, both internally and client-related?</strong></p>
<p>I am a "Drupal Developer", which means I take care of the nuts and bolts of building and maintaining Drupal sites.</p>
<p><strong>2. Give us an idea of what professional path brought you here.</strong></p>
<p>I went to school for Computer Science and worked in IT for Georgia Tech. I tried leaving the IT world a few times but kept getting drawn back!</p>
<p><strong>3. How did you first get involved with Drupal?</strong></p>
<p>Some colleagues showed me how they were using Drupal to maintain their department's websites, and I jumped on board immediately. I had inherited a site that used Adobe Contribute to provide a WYSIWYG editing experience.</p>
