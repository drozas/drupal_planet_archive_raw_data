    <p>I mentioned in the &lt; href="393798"&gt;recap of the Green by 2014 initiative that I've been working to organize a follow-on effort to continue building our automated accessibility testing tools. I just published the announcement at the following URL.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/p/c1a3a275fe1a" title="https://medium.com/p/c1a3a275fe1a">https://medium.com/p/c1a3a275fe1a</a></p>
<p>Here's the title and sub-title:</p>
<p>"Open-source accessibility testing for the modern web"</p>
<p>"Collaborating to improve Quail, an open-source web accessibility testing tool that will integrate with existing continuous integration processes and developer toolchains."</p>
<p>Please give it a read and share the announcement on your networks. We want to get as much outside involvement as possible from developers, accessibility experts, testers and library architects. With this project we have the resources to build the world's first modern accessibility testing tool for front end applications and web pages. What we need now is the momentum to get it built quickly.</p>
