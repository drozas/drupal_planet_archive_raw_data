This week I had an opportunity to meet <a href="http://www.weforum.org/professor-klaus-schwab-founder-and-executive-chairman">Professor Klaus Schwab</a>, Founder and Executive Chairman of the <a href="http://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum</a>. I was inspired by the following comment he made (not his exact words): </p>
<p><cite>"Because companies strive to have a positive balance sheet, they take more in, than they give out. However, as individuals, we define success as giving more than you take. Given that many of us are leaders as individuals *and* also leaders in our businesses, we often wrestle with these opposing forces. Therein lies the leadership challenge."</cite></p>
<p>I’ve seen many Open Source developers struggle with this as they are inherently wired to give back more than they take.  Open Source developers often distrust businesses, sometimes including their own employer, because they take more than they give back.  They believe businesses just act out of greed and self-interest.</p>
<p>This kind of corporate distrust comes from the “fixed-pie concept"; that there is only so much work or resources to go around, and as pieces of the pie are taken by some, there is less left for everyone else. The reality is that businesses are often focused on expanding the pie. As the pie grows, there is more for everyone.  It is those who believe in the "expanding-pie concept" who can balance the opposing forces.  It is those who believe in the "fixed-pie concept" who worry about their own self-interests and distrust businesses.</p>
<p>Imagine a business that is born out of a desire to improve the world, that delivers real value to everyone it touches. A business that makes employees proud and where team members are passionate and committed. A business that aspires to do more than just turn a profit.  A business that wants to help fuel a force of good. That is Acquia for me.  That should be your employer for you (whoever your employer is).</p>
<p>The myth that profit maximization is the sole purpose of business is outdated, yet so many people seem to hold on to it. I <a href="http://buytaert.net/acquia-my-drupal-startup">started Acquia</a> because I believed in the potential and transformative nature of <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> and Open Source. The purpose of business is to improve our lives and create value for all stakeholders. </p>
<p>Acquia's growth and capital position has given me power and responsibility.  Power and responsibility that has enabled me to give back more and grow the pie.  I have seen the power that businesses have to improve the world by accelerating the power of good, even if they have to take more than they give. It's a story worth telling because business is not a zero-sum game with one winner.  I believe Open Source companies are in a prime position to balance the opposing forces.  We can do well and do good.</p>
