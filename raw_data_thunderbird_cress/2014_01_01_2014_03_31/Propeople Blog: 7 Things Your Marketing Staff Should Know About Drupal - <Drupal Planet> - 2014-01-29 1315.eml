Drupal is a popular Content Management System, and one of the top frameworks used by Fortune 500 companies. I can assure you, that it’s not just because those companies like the name of it. Security, scalability and flexibility make Drupal popular among the big boys, but that is not all - Drupal is also a great marketing platform! Those who know this are one step ahead of the rest. We call them the “Enlightened”.</p>

<p>So let’s cut to the chase, shall we? Here are seven important facts those managing your marketing efforts must know about Drupal.</p>



<h3>You can integrate any CRM with Drupal</h3>
<p>One of the keys to marketing success is efficient data analysis. In order to create effectively-targeted online campaigns, your marketing staff needs to know as many details about your visitors as possible. Google Analytics is a great tool to get started with, but eventually your business will need something more precise - a Customer Relationship Management tool.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Drupal can be integrated with any CRM tool out there. For example, Sales Force, one of the leading players in the CRM software business, has a dedicated <a href="/blog/crm-integration-with-drupal" target="_blank">article</a> on their website which describes how easy it is to integrate their software with Drupal, and provides detailed information about data synchronization between your Drupal-powered site and Salesforce CRM software.</p>

<p>Drupal also has a bunch of great <a href="/blog/crm-integration-with-drupal">CRM modules</a> that can be installed and configured.</p>



<h3>Drupal is great at SEO</h3>
<p>Times are changing, and SEO is not what it used to be. For many of us, it may seem hard to keep up with all the new trends and SEO techniques. Not for Drupal. By default, Drupal comes with a set of powerful SEO features, and these are supplemented by a collection of constantly updated and improved SEO modules.</p>

<p>Drupal’s well-crafted structure provides a huge SEO advantage to your website. It facilitates good optimization of any type of published content. Images and videos can be optimized on the go, and this is great! It saves time and keeps you away from that HTML code that you probably don’t want to be playing with. Another great feature of Drupal is that it gives you complete control over your URL structure. You can attribute custom URLs to any content item on your website based on your best judgement. </p>

<p>Everything from Drupal’s categorization system to its clever information architecture make it perfect for Search Engine indexation.</p>

<h3>Content is king, and Drupal knows it!</h3>
<p>Content Construction Kit! These three words represent the answer to any type of content-related question when it comes to Drupal. Content Construction Kit, CCK for short, is the module that will turn any content marketing fantasy into reality. CCK allows you to create endless content types and customize them based on your defined strategy. No programming knowledge is required.</p>

<p>Additionally, Drupal is flexible and extendible. These two features are critical if you need a platform to be the foundation of your marketing content. The arrangement of content on your website is very important. Manipulating the structure of your pages should be easy, and it is with Drupal.</p>


<h3>E-Mail Campaigns? Yes.</h3>
<p>How important is email marketing? Very important! Email is one of the main ways we interact with people around us. A well-thought email campaign can bring a lot of benefits to your business, and having a platform that helps you effectively automate your email feeds is an important advantage.</p>

<p>One of the most popular mailing services people integrate with Drupal these days is MailChimp. However, Drupal also provides a bunch of great alternatives for this very purpose that are easy to use and rich in possibilities. From sending out bulk email to categorizing email recipients into groups for better email targeting, it’s all covered.</p>


<h3>Social Media Integrability</h3>
<p>Marketing has changed dramatically because of social media’s popularity. Having a site that doesn’t give its visitors the possibility to hit “Share” is unacceptable. Social media plays a huge role in promoting your products and services. </p>

<p>Luckily, it’s very easy to integrate Drupal with any social network you can think of. Sharing buttons and signing up using a social media account is just the beginning of what Drupal can do.</p>

<h3>Landing Pages</h3>
<p>Well, this should be obvious. Every CMS should provide an easy way to create landing pages. Unfortunately not all Content Management Systems are so easy to operate. Drupal, on the other hand, is one of the top platforms when it comes to crafting and managing landing pages. By using the Panels module you can build any type of landing page for your Drupal-powered website. Including everything from video blocks to contact forms on your landing page is easy and fun with Drupal.</p>

<p>With Drupal you can create multiple landing pages, perform A/B testing, and then adjust them to suit your goals from your site’s backend within minutes. With the right design and Drupal’s page-creating functionality, your landing pages will be as effective as ever.</p>


<h3>Drupal is Mobile Friendly</h3>
<p>I’m not going to take you through the numbers...you already know the importance of mobile devices in today’s web world. It doesn’t matter if it’s a web store or a simple presentation site - you want it designed for mobile devices, period. </p>

<p>You might have heard that Drupal is complex and mobile unfriendly. Well, let me dispel that myth for you. It might have been the case a long time ago, but now, that’s just simply not true.</p>

<p>Drupal’s large community of developers successfully managed to turn Drupal into a great CMS for portable devices. The large number of <a href="/blog/the-best-responsive-web-design-tools">responsive design</a> themes available is mindblowing. Lots of modules are also available to help you provide the best surfing experience for your visitors, no matter what device they use to find their way around your website. Perhaps the best thing about it is that Drupal isn’t just great at frontend, but it also gives you a mobile-friendly backend dashboard that makes it easy for site administrators and content managers to operate the site from phones and tablets just as easily as from any desktop computer.</p>
