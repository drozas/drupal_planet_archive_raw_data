I finally had a look into the problem last night and <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2172893">identified the cause of the problem and implemented a workaround</a> which other Drupal <a href="https://drupal.org/project/blogspam">Blogspam module</a> users are welcome to copy.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.steve.org.uk/">Steve Kemp</a> for providing the <a href="http://blogspam.net/">Blogspam</a> service.  Anything but thanks to those who provide the spam.</p>
