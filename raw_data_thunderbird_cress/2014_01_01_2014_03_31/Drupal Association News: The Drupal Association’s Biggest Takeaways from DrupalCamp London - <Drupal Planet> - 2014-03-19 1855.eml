After I joined the Drupal Association, DrupalCon London was the first Con I worked on from beginning to end, and it was where I was fully introduced to the incredible Drupal spirit. I built great friendships with so many wonderful community members, who gave up their free time to help make that event a success.</p></div></div></div>
