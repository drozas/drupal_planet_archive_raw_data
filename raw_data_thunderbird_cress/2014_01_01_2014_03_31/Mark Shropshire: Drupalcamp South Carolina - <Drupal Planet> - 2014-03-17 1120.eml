    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>When I first heard that the a number of Drupalers in South Carolina were planning a camp, I was excited, but knee deep in organizing the <a href="http://charlottedrupaldrive.in">Charlotte Drupal-Drive</a> with Thomas Lattimore. All I could do at the time was mentally commit to going.</p>

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.drupalcampsc.com">Drupalcamp South Carolina</a> is a little more than a month away, I am getting very excited about it. It is nice to have a local camp to tide me over until <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/node">Drupalcon Austin</a>.</p>

<p>The camp is happening on Saturday, April 19th at IT-oLogy in Columbia, SC. <a href="https://www.drupalcampsc.com/pre-camp-training">Pre-camp training</a> will occur on Friday, April 18th, featuring beginner Drupal and Commerce Kickstart classes.</p>

<p>Drupalcamp South Carolina will feature a keynote by <a href="https://drupal.org/user/49344">Ryan Szrama</a>, of Commerce Guys, and a day of sessions covering a wide range of Drupal related topics. Session tracks include, beginner, design/ theming/usability, and development &amp; performance. Following a full day of sessions, attendees are invited to the <a href="https://www.drupalcampsc.com/after-party">after party</a>, which will be held at <a href="http://fivepointscolumbia.com">Five Points</a>. If you can allocate time Sunday, there will be an after-camp outdoor adventure (more details to come).</p>

<p>Session proposals are now in full swing. Make sure to <a href="https://www.drupalcampsc.com/product-event/drupalcamp-sc-registration">register</a> for the camp and propose a session. Presenting at a camp is a great way to share your passion for Drupal.</p>
