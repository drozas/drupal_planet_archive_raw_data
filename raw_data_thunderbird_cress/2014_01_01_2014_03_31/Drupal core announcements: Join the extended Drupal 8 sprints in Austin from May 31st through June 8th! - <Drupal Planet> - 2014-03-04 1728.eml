    <title>Drupal core announcements: Join the extended Drupal 8 sprints in Austin from May 31st through June 8th!</title>

    <p>We have a great tradition of extended sprints around big Drupal events including the ones we did around DrupalCons in Prague, Portland, Munich, Denver, as well as Drupal Dev Days like Szeged, Dublin and Barcelona. While there is a sprint day included in DrupalCons (usually) on Friday, given that a lot of the Drupal core and contrib developers fly in for these events, it makes a lot of sense to use this opportunity to start sooner and/or extend our stay and work together in one space on the harder problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Austin</a> is next up! DrupalCon and the Drupal Association continue to recognize the need for extended sprints as part of the schedule and are providing space on Monday, and helping organize space for the weekends before and after also! We are still looking for additional sponsors for the weekend sprints before/after to help with coffee, tea and maybe food. </p>
<!-- There are already various sprints signed up including <em>Multilingual, a group working to clear Beta/RC blockers,</em> all to further development of Drupal 8 at various capacities on these weekends.--><!-- There are already various sprints signed up including <em>Multilingual, a group working to clear Beta/RC blockers,</em> all to further development of Drupal 8 at various capacities on these weekends.--><h3>Travel Plans</h3>
