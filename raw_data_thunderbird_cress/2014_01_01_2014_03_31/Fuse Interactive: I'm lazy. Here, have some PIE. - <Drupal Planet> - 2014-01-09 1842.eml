    <p>I'm a lazy developer. Probably one of the laziest I know. I try not to commit anything to memory that can be looked up with 2 seconds of typing and a click. If I know someone else knows the answer and they're within earshot I'm definitely not going to sit around and try to figure it out myself. That's not to say I won't work hard or can't learn, but it's all about efficiency in the work place for me.</p>
