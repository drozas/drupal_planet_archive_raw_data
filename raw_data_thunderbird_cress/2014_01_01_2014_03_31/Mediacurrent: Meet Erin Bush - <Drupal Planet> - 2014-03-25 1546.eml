<p dir="ltr"><span>My title is Business Development. &nbsp;This includes working with prospective clients to see if Mediacurrent can solve their Drupal and Digital Strategy needs. &nbsp;I also work with our Partners and Alliances to better serve our clients and provide a complete solution. &nbsp;Internally, I work a lot with our Marketing and Project Management teams. &nbsp;As someone goes from visiting our website to a Discovery engagement to a site maintenance plan, I try to keep everything moving in the right direction. </span></p>
<p><strong>2. &nbsp;Weâ€™re so glad to have you! &nbsp;Give us an idea of what professional path brought you here.</strong></p>
