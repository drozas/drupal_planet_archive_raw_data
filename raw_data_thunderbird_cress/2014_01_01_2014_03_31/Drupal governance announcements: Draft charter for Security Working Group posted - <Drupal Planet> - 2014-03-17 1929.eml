    <title>Drupal governance announcements: Draft charter for Security Working Group posted</title>

    <p>Michael Hess, Greg Knaddison, Mori Sugimoto, Ben Jeavons, Matt Chapman, Angie Byron and myself have been working on the charter for the Security Working Group (DocWG).  The mission of the SecWG is to ensure that Drupal core and Drupal's contributed project ecosystem provide world-class security, and to provide security best practices for site builders and module developers. The work is part of <a href="http://buytaert.net/proposal-from-first-drupal-governance-sprint">our work on evolving and streamlining the Drupal project's governance</a>.</p>
<p>We just shared <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2219757">our proposed SecWG charter</a>, which has also been run by the existing security team, and now we are looking for feedback and input from the community before formalizing it.  We hope to finalize this within the next month, so that leaves some time for community feedback.</p>
