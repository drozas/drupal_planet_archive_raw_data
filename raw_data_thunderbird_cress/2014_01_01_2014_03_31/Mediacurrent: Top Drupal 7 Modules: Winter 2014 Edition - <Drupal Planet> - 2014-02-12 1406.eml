<h3 dir="ltr">Introduction to Jayâ€™s Winter List</h3>
<p><br />It has been awhile since I have <a href="http://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/top-drupal-7-modules-summer-2012-edition" target="_blank">published a top modules list for Drupal</a>&nbsp;so I thought with <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-8.0" target="_blank">Drupal 8 coming out soon</a> it was time for one last top Drupal 7 modules list. As I have stated in past blogs on this subject, it can be very challenging to sort through the literally thousands of modules available for Drupal. Therefore, what I like to do as an <a href="https://drupal.org/user/42248" target="_blank">8 year veteran of Drupal</a>&nbsp;is routinely publish a list of modules that I use most often on projects. In doing so I hope to give newbie developers a good list to start with. Some intermediate developers might also find a handful of less obvious modules that can help them out on their next project as well.</p>
