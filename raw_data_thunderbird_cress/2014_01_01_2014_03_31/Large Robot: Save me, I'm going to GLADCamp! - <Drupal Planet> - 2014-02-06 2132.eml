    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>GLADCamp, the Greater Los Angeles Drupal Camp, is coming up in a couple weeks and I'm helping organize a couple events that make up the conference program. I'm incredibly excited, and at the same time I'm feeling like I might be going out of my mind. </p>
<p>Depending on where you are or how far you're willing to go, this kind of event just doesn't happen very often (if at all). We have a non-profit summit, a job fair, an employers summit, a barn raising for a non-profit and our first-ever website performance speed competition.</p>
<p>That's in addition to a general DrupalCamp with keynotes, sessions, BoFs,  trainings and code sprints.</p>
<p><a href="https://gladcamp.org"><img src="https://largerobot.com/sites/default/files/gladcamp-banner-800x250-2.png" width="800" height="250" alt="GLADCamp 2014" align="center" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>You have to be crazy to run one of these events, and I have the tremendous fortune of being a member of a great team of <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/organizerl">crazy organizers</a>. From the outside we all must look nuts but we've all drunk from the well like the one in Khalil Gibran's <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5616">The Madman</a> and together we're keeping each other sane.</p>
<p>We've organized camps, job fairs, tech summits, and website barn raisings before, so what's the big deal? </p>
<p>This is a new event. It's a mega event, but it's still new. GLADCamp has only recently popped up on the radar for many people and it doesn't yet have much name recognition. Will anyone come?</p>
<p>It's always a gamble that we'll be able to meet our venue costs and book the hotel room nights we've reserved. Our group has a commitment to <a href="https://drupal.la/resources/governance-policy">transparency</a> and <a href="https://drupal.la/resources/governance-policy#accountability">accountability</a> and we have open books for this conference, and this will probably lead to more criticism than less if we make mistakes.</p>
<p>On a personal note,  my dance card has been pretty full over the past couple of years (see <a href="https://largerobot.com/articles/recharging-batteries">Recharging batteries</a>). One of my goals for 2014 is to consolidate as many of my Drupal community efforts as possible into one big event and GLADCamp is it. This is a different approach for me and I'll just have to see if it works.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, this is going to be big. Fingers crossed!</p>
