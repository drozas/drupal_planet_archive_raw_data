My fifth time nervously counting the submissions as they come rolling in, first at a trickle, maybe 20 in a week. Then stagnation, followed by a bit of a panic - did we remember to tell people?? </p>
<p>And then suddenly, the week sessions close, the sessions come pouring in like a flood. In just this last week, submissions increased nearly 400%.</p>
