    <p>It took a little while but I&#39;m really happy to be able to say that there is a
set of very good JS people around in the core issue queue. I know there are
some out there in contrib but unfortunately very few show up in the core
issue queue. We&#39;re nice and we have cookies, don&#39;t be afraid!</p>

<p>The short story is that back in february 2012, after writing <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=JavaScript+clean-up">JavaScript
clean-up</a> patches for a few months, webchick told me on IRC that
she wouldn&#39;t have a problem with me stepping up as JS maintainer,
so <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1447040">I did</a>. Lacking people to review JS patches I approached
<a href="https://drupal.org/user/264148">seutje</a> on <a href="https://drupal.org/user/382101">kristofvanroy</a>&#39;s recommendation. It
was at DrupalCon Munich — 3am,  at the bar — that I <del>conned</del> talked
seutje into being co-maintainer. Thanks to him, patches were reviewed,
more patches were written and I stopped being down about the lack of progress
 in JS.</p>

<p>Few months later, with new and fancy functionalities piling up in core — edit
module, the new toolbar, wysiwyg — and given my lack of interest for Backbone I
<del>coerced</del> asked nicely <a href="https://drupal.org/user/748566">jessebeach</a> to be maintainer
with us since she appreciates the library and can walk the walk. We&#39;re pretty
much the <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git/blob/refs/heads/8.x:/core/MAINTAINERS.txt#l116">three musketeers of core javascript</a>. But we can&#39;t be the
three musketeers without the forth one: <a href="https://drupal.org/user/99777">Wim Leers</a>. Over time he&#39;s
been the one writing the most JS for core through his work on edit and wysiwyg.</p>

<p>I also want to give a shout out to <a href="https://drupal.org/user/591932">droplet</a> who&#39;s been reminding us
that europe an north america are not the only Drupal users while sending out
really good patches. Thanks to <a href="https://drupal.org/user/412171">SebCorbin</a> for working on a major
and very <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1764252">important architectural change</a>. Of course thanks
to: <a href="https://drupal.org/user/25701">mfer</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/139855">ksenzee</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/32095">JohnAlbin</a>,
<a href="https://drupal.org/user/105002">attiks</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/411999">rupl</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/146719">sdboyer</a>,
<a href="https://drupal.org/user/780508">rteijeiro</a> and everyone else working for a better JS in Drupal.</p>
