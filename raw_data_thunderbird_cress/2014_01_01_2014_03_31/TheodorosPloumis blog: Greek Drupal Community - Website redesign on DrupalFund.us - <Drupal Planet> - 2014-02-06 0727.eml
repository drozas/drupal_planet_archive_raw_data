<p>We are the Greek Drupal community, a small but active community! We are organizing DrupalCamps, monthly meetups in several cities of Greece, translation sprints and other events regarding Drupal. We currently count more than 500 members in our local community website.</p>
<p>We decided to move forward and do more things for the Greek Drupal Community. Thus, we set up this&nbsp;<strong>small funding project</strong>.</p>
<p>We need the money for these simple reasons:</p>
<p>1) Our online community -&nbsp;<a href="http://mydrupal.gr/" title="http://mydrupal.gr">http://mydrupal.gr</a>&nbsp;- is a bit old fashion and nonfunctional website. We are planning to upgrade the site from 6.x to 7.x and make a complete redesign.</p>
<p>2) We need to pay for a new hosting that supports ssh, Drush, git, SASS and automated backups.</p>
<p>We don't want to have company sponsorship and such. We believe in people's power and this is a reason why we use Open Source software.</p>
<p>This funding project mainly aims to Greek Drupal lovers and the Greek Drupal community but anyone else is welcome.</p>
