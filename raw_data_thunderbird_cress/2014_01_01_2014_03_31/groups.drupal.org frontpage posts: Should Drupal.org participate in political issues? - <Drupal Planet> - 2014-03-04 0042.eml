  <body id="msgFeedSummaryBody" selected="false">
    <p>Recently, the Association posted a discussion here in groups (<a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/398548" title="https://groups.drupal.org/node/398548">https://groups.drupal.org/node/398548</a>) which resulted in the Association registering Drupal.org to participate in TheDayWeFightBack (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2188053" title="https://drupal.org/node/2188053">https://drupal.org/node/2188053</a>). As we have discussed, there were technical issues we could have addressed differently (see the discussion: <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/407283" title="https://groups.drupal.org/node/407283">https://groups.drupal.org/node/407283</a>), but we also heard from many community members who felt that Drupal.org should never be involved in any kind of political campaign at all. An in this case, I'll use "political" with a small "p" to indicate the very broadest definition - from political candidate campaigns to "political" stances.</p>
<p>In fact, as an example of politics with a small "p," we were recently asked to participate in the Open Innovation Network (<a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/" title="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/</a>) by signing on as a supporter (though the patent work obviously does not directly affect us).</p>
<p>I promised to address this question specifically in a follow up post - so here it is! We want to hear from you, but we ask that you please help make the conversation as constructive as possible. These discussions get heated quickly, so here are some ground rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critique the idea with logic, not emotion</li>
<li>Don't critique the messenger, just the idea</li>
<li>Try not to take criticism of your idea personally</li>
<li>No swearing</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally - help us have a broad conversation. Share this post widely.</p>
