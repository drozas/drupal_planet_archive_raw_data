There was pizza (from SGD), beer (from our gracious meetup host CPX Interactive), and a <em>fabulous</em> (if I may say so) birthday cake we at Blink Reaction chipped in. The treats were accompanied by yet another excellent and informative program of lightning talks and presentations from Drupalers both local and remote.</div></div></div>
