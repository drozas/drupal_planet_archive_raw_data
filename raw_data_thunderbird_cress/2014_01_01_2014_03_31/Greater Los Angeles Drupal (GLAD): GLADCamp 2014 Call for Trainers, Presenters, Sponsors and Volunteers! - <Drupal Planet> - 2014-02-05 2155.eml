It's in sunny Pasadena, California, and will be taking place at the Hilton Pasadena &amp; Convention Center.</p>
<p>In addition to being a DrupalCamp for all things Drupal with keynotes, sessions, trainings and BoFs, we're having a non-profit Drupal summit on March 7th, a website speed test competition throughout the conference  (called the <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/extreme-drupal-games">Extreme Drupal Games</a>), and a <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/barn-raising">website barn raising</a> on March 9th to benefit a local 501c3 non-profit.</p>
<p>We're also looking for <a href="https://gladcamp.org/program/sessions/proposed">session proposals</a> and <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/become-a-sponsor">sponsorships</a>. Would you like to make a <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/donations">tax-deductible donation</a>? We do that, too!</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://gladcamp.org">GLADCamp.org</a> and sign up. We've negotiated a group rate at the Hilton Pasadena and have all kinds of <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/venue">venue information</a> for those interested in attending.</p>
<h3>Call for Trainings!</h3>
<p>Training day at GLADCamp 2014 is on March 7th, 2014. We have room at our conference venue for 3 simultaneous trainings and are starting our call for trainings! <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/training">Everyone is welcome to apply</a>.</p>
<p>Space is limited and priority is given to experienced Drupal trainers and training companies. Don't let that discourage you, though. If you're a newcomer to the Drupal training scene and want to offer something no one has offered before, we'd love to hear from you!</p>
<p>If the training you'd like to provide is a paid training, please be sure to indicate that in your application. In order to create an even playing field for everyone, our preference is to either have all trainings be free or all trainings be paid.</p>
