	Part 2 of 2 - I had the great pleasure of speaking with Lukas Smith at SymfonyCon Warsaw in December, 2013. Lukas is a major contributor to open source and is involved in a range of projects, including the Symfony framework, Drupal, and many more. He is <a href="http://github.com/lsmith77">one of the 50 most active contributors on GitHub</a>. Thank you, Lukas!
