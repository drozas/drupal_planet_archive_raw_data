It's become an essential module for when you need to change the layout and fields on a node or any entity page.</p>

<p>Today I want to talk about a piece of functionality that you may not be aware of in Display Suite. It's the ability to switch the view mode will be used for an individual node.</p>

<p>Let me explain, when you go to a node page (node/1) the "Full content" view mode is displayed. But, you can only have a single version of this view mode for each content type.</p>

<p>Display Suite can be setup to allow authors to select a specific view mode on an individual node.</p>

<p>Instead of displaying "Full content", you could, on a select group of nodes use another view mode called "Feature landing page".</p>

<p>This functionality is not exclusive to Display Suite. You can do similar stuff using <a href="https://drupal.org/project/panels">Panels</a> or <a href="https://drupal.org/project/panelizer">Panelizer</a>.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a custom view mode called "Full content feature" and we'll allow an editor to select which one will be used on individual nodes.</p>
