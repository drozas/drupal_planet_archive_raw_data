<h4>Drupal's growing up</h4>
<p>The event itself had more of a DrupalCon feel than a Camp - emphasising the view that Drupal community is 'growing up', something that Associate Director at Drupal Association, Megan Sanicki, also hit home in her keynote. We were lucky enough to catch up with Megan where she <a href="http://deeson-online.co.uk/blog/drupalcamp-london-interview-megan-sanicki">expanded on topics covered in her speech.</a></p>
<h4>Expanding the Drupal talent pool</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">                          <img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/uploads/image_2.jpeg" style="width: 420px; height: 315px;" /></p>
<p>Talent was also very much part of the focus of DrupalCamp London. This was not only reflected in the attendance of a group of Drupal Apprentices (above) who met with potential employees at a special Bof, but also with the inclusion of Eric Gaffen, Global Manager, Talent Acquisition at Acquia. Eric travelled over from Boston to be at the event, and in this great short video told us why <a href="http://deeson-online.co.uk/blog/drupalcamp-london-how-get-best-talent-drupal">nurturing great Drupal talent is important for the whole of the Drupal ecosystem.</a></p>
<h4>Networking, sessions... and swag!</h4>
<p>Deeson Online not only sponsored it, MD Tim Deeson was also one of the organisers. And as this Vine proves, was also king of networking...</p>
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://vine.co/v/MK3YxrMeZ6b/embed/simple" width="420"></iframe><p>Deeson Online Developer Annika Clarke gave a session entitled Introducing <a href="https://drupal.org/project/df">Demo Framework</a>, a distribution that aims to make the process of pitching Drupal to new clients a lot easier, while Solutions Architect John Ennew delivered his session on concurrent programming in Drupal. We'll be putting up their well-attended presentations very soon - so watch this space.</p>

<p><script async="" src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But as is the case with anything vaguely Drupaly... it's the swag that people really love, and our We Are Smarter Than Me tees went down a storm again!</p>
<p><iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://vine.co/v/MKPmLWTP9lb/embed/simple" width="420"></iframe><script async="" src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>2014 DrupalCamp London definitely upped the game, and next year's event will no doubt build on the great foundations set down last weekend. We're looking forward to it already!</p>
