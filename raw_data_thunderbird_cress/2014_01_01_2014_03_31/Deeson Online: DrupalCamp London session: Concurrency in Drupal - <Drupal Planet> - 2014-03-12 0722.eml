It was my first time running a session, but my training topic, Concurrency in Drupal, turned out to be a popular choice!</p>
<h4>What is Concurrency in Drupal?</h4>
<p>Concurrency in Drupal is the description and demonstration of making migrate faster. You can learn more about it in a <a href="http://deeson-online.co.uk/labs/multi-processing-part-1-how-make-drush-rush">previous blog of mine. </a></p>
<h4>The session</h4>
<p>During my half-hour session, I covered the basics of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why concurrency makes programs faster and;</li>
<li>How to wrapper drush and migrate to make it execute in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The presentation</h4>

<h4>The wisdom of the crowd</h4>
<p>The great thing about DrupalCamps are the discussions that take place - and there was an interesting debate after my session where the conference delegates described other approaches to solving the problem.</p>
<p>For example, a number of participants liked the ‘brave’ live demo which showed a migration first taking two minutes with one process, and dropping to around 20 seconds with eight processes.</p>
<h4>Would I do it again?</h4>
<p>Actually, yes. I would.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a good first 'Drupal session' experience - so if you have discovered something of interest to share with the community, I'd recommend you give it a go!</p>
