I just finished up a small project at work to create a basic resource management calendar to visualize and manage room and other asset reservations. The idea was to have a calendar that displayed reservations for various resources and allow privileged users the ability add reservations themselves. The existing system that was being used was a pain to work with and very time consuming - and I knew this could be done easily in Drupal 7.</p></div></div></div>
