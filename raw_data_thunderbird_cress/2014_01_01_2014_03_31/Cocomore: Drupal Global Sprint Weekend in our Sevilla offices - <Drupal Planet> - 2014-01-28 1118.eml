    <p>On January 25th and 26th, for the first time in Sevilla, the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/sevilla" alt="Sevilla Drupal User Group homepage">local community</a> took part of the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/332998">Drupal Global Sprint Weekend </a>, a worldwide <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term143"><dfn title="An event in Drupal can have two different meanings. 1) any change in state of a page or piece of content, e.g. a node being set to “published” could be an “event” which triggers its inclusion in the site's RSS feed. Similarly, “event” can also refer to Javascript triggers such as, a “mouse-over” (aka “hover”) event, a completed page load, etc. And 2) “event”, of course, can also have the meaning of a calendar event, e.g. a node created with the Event module (something now more commonly done with the Date and Calendar modules, which work together to provide another solution for “event” scheduling).">event</dfn></a> where people join together and contribute back to Drupal.
We are very proud for having hosted this event, which filled our office with a group of 20 individuals willing to contribute and mentor contributors.</p> <p><a href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/blog/drupal-global-sprint-weekend-our-sevilla-offices" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
