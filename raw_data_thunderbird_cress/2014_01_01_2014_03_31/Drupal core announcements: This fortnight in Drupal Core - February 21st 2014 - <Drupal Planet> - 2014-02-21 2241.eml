    <h2 id="new">What's new with Drupal 8?</h2>
<p>This week (fortnight) saw the release of Drupal 8 alpha 9. Each release brings us that little bit closer to a beta. Some of the highlights from this fortnight include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all Simpletest overrides and rely on native multi-site functionality instead - <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2171683">issue 2171683</a>. With this, each test run creates its own site inside sites/simpletest - eg sites/simpletest/13455678 - with its own settings.php and some apache files for security sake. This means that our testing is running in a real site, instead of a psuedo site with overloaded globals and various other workarounds.</li>
<li>The direct callability of theme() was removed in favor of building render arrays consistently. It has been renamed to _theme() and is for internal use only. Build render arrays instead of using _theme() in your code so you don't break caching, assets and JavaScript states, amongst other things. For more information see the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2195739">change record</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And speaking of change records, just a reminder to check your patches for API changes and be sure to write your change record, these are now required before the issue is committed.</p>
<h2 id="release">Where's Drupal 8 at in terms of release?</h2>
<p>Last week, we fixed 11 critical issues and 14 major issues, and opened 4 criticals and 9 majors. That puts us overall at <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">116 release-blocking critical issues</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=15&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=300&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">484 major issues</a>.</p>
<p>5 beta-blocking issues were fixed last week. There are still <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=beta+blocker">51 of 124 beta blockers</a> that must be resolved and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=Open&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=Missing+change+record">14 change records</a> that must be written before we can <a href="http://buytaert.net/the-next-step-for-drupal-8-is-a-beta">release a Drupal 8 beta</a>.</p>
<h2 id="help">Where can I help?</h2>
<h3 id="top">Top criticals to hit this week</h3>
<p>Each week, we check with core maintainers and contributors for the "extra critical" criticals that are blocking other work. These issues are often tough problems with a long history. If you're familiar with the problem space of one of these issues and have the time to dig in, help drive it forward by reviewing, improving, and testing its patch, and by making sure the issue's summary is up to date and any API changes are documented with a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/402688">draft change record</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2198429">#2198429: Remove deleted fields concept</a> blocks critical work on dependency management and configuration synchronization. If you have expertise on the configurable field system, the configuration system, the batch API, or large deployments and data deletions in general, please weigh in on this issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2114707">#2114707: Allow per-bundle overrides of field definitions</a> This is a current key blocker for entity API work, and needs review.</li>
<li>Anything that helps us unblock testbot testing on php 5.4 -- <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=phpfpm-testbot">see this issue list of php-fpm issues</a>.
</li></ul>

<li>If you use PostgreSQL, please help with <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2157455">#2157455: [Meta] Make Drupal 8 work with PostgreSQL</a>. These issues are critical to make Drupal 8 shippable for postgres, and they block adding automated test coverage on postgres that will help prevent further regressions.</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1938068">#1938068: [Meta] Convert UnitTestBase to PHPUnit</a>. These issues are a great chance to familiarize yourself with PHPUnit and make Drupal 8's test suite cleaner and faster. Help with reviews on the child issues!</li>
