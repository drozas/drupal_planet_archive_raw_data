Roughly one year on from her appointment to the Drupal Association job, I got the chance to ask her about her Drupal "origin story", what she thinks about the community now that she's in the thick of things (we're a welcoming and diverse bunch), and the role of technology and especially Drupal in making the world a better place.</p>
