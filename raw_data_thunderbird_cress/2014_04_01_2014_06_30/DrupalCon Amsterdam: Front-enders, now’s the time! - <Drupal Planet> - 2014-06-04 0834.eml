<p>This year is when Drupal 8 is going to be released and is going to bring a clean, fresh and totally rebuilt front-end. Front-end and design related topics that are not specific to Drupal are very welcome. If you need some help on deciding your session subject just take a look at our suggestions for the Front-end Track.</p>
<p>We know you have something interesting to show and we will be really glad if you want to share it with all these fellow Drupalists attending DrupalCon Amsterdam. So, please don’t be shy, don’t be afraid. You’re an interesting and good looking person.</p>
