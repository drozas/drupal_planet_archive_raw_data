    <h2>Treat your custom CSS as contrib</h2>

<p>Getting your Drupal to be pixel perfect is hard. In fact, it&#39;s probably four times faster to write the logic
of a page, in comparison to the time it takes to get it&#39;s markup right. Not to talk about making it responsive.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen my presentation about <a href="http://goo.gl/hJhZb8">The Gizra Way</a> you noticed we take pixel perfect very seriously.</p>

<p>One of the tools that helps us getting the markup fast, correct and in a way that would allow us to communicate with the client is Jekyll - the static site generator. Here&#39;s the idea in a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using Jekyll we can concentrate on a clean markup</li>
<li>Using Grunt we compile the SASS, and are able to push the the HTML into Github pages - where the client can easily see and interact with the final markup</li>
<li>The CSS produced by Jekyll is treated by our Drupal application as contrib. This means we have zero custom CSS in our theme. Seriously, <strong>absolutely no custom CSS in your Drupal theme!</strong></li>
<li>Any change to the CSS can be done only in a <em>single</em> place, which is Jekyll</li>
</ul>
