The Drupal Association's Board of Directors supports Morten’s decision. The <a href="http://association.drupal.org">Drupal Association</a> and the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal community</a> value inclusivity and diversity, and our leadership must demonstrate those values as well. </p>
<p>We want to thank Morten for his service; he came to the board with a mission to foster improved transparency and communication.  He helped both the board and staff embrace those principles in a way that will carry into the future.</p>
<p>Today’s development underscores the need for a broader discussion that we need to have about inclusivity and diversity.  Creating and maintaining the right culture and environment is vital to Drupal's success. Therefore, we have asked the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/community-working-group">Community Working Group</a> to define a process to help our community address these issues and identify positive, proactive, and concrete steps we can take to ensure that everyone feels welcome in Drupal.  </p>
<p>Morten is vacating a community elected seat. The Board of Directors will discuss how and when to fill this vacancy at the next board meeting. </p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p><a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/about/board">Drupal Association Board of Directors</a></p>
