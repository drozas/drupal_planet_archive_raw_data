<p>The monthly Drupal core bug fix release window is this Wednesday, and since it has been a while since the last one, I plan to release Drupal 7.28 on that date.  However, in practice the release might not happen until Thursday, to give people a bit more time to test the latest code.  Per our release policy, this will be a bug fix release only (no security fixes).</p>
<p>The final patches for 7.28 have been committed and the code is frozen (excluding documentation fixes and fixes for any regressions that may be found in the next couple days).  So, now is a wonderful time to update your development/staging servers to the latest 7.x code and help us catch any regressions in advance.</p>
<p>Drupal 7.28 does not have any new features or API changes that are large enough to warrant an official change record, but there are numerous significant improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for a JavaScript regression in older browsers (typically Internet Explorer 8 and earlier) that was accidentally introduced in the <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-7.27-release-notes">Drupal 7.27 security release</a>.</li>
<li>A change which should make the Update Manager module more reliable about reporting correct information about security updates to site administrators.  This change has some possible performance implications though, so we're particularly interested in any testing and feedback on the drupal.org issue: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/952394">"No available releases found" - fetching update information exceeds timeout</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might also be interested in the tentative <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git/blob/refs/heads/7.x:/CHANGELOG.txt#l2">CHANGELOG.txt</a> for Drupal 7.28 and the corresponding list of important issues that will be <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=7.28%20release%20notes">highlighted in the Drupal 7.28 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>If you do find any regressions, please report them in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?version=7.x">issue queue</a>.  Thanks!</p>
<p>Upcoming release windows after this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, May 21 (security release window)</li>
<li>Wednesday, June 4 (bug fix release window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on Drupal core release windows, see the documentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info#when">release timing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173280">security releases</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/260803">discussion</a> that led to this policy being implemented.</p>
