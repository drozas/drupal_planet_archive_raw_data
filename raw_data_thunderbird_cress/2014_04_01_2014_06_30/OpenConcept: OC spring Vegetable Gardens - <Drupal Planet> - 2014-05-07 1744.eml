    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-fulltext"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>There are many great things about working for OpenConcept, but two that I appreciate in particular are the homemade lunches we take turns making for everyone and share each day, and the fact that we are encouraged to follow our own interests. OC always gets behind you on your pet projects.</p>
<p><img alt="A 7 foot by 5 foot raised garden and a narrow garden bed along the back of the building where it receives sun for the majority of the day." src="https://openconcept.ca/sites/openconcept/files/may_raised_bed_2014.jpg" style="height: 198px; line-height: 18.211200714111328px; width: 300px; float: right; padding: 10px 0px 10px 10px;" /></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">Personally, I love to grow my own food and have been encouraging urban farming initiatives locally here in Ottawa for some time now. In 2013, I was pleased to be able to start a garden here at OC headquarters to supplement the garden space I have at my own home. The idea is that from the veggies grown at OC some will come home with me and the rest will be used for our communal lunches. Last year the garden wasn't built until pretty late in the season, but we were able to grow a few zucchinis, some peppers and a little swiss chard. This season I've got a jump on the planting. The gardens are now prepared and there are a few things growing already. I even have a plan for crop rotation as things grow and finish as the season progresses. Woot, woot!</span></p>
<p>Above is a photo of what our garden space looks like. There is a 7 foot by 5 foot raised bed and a narrow garden bed along the backside of the building.</p>
<p><img alt="Garlic sprouting through the soil in the raised bed." src="https://openconcept.ca/sites/openconcept/files/may_garlic_2014.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 356px; float: left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 0px;" />Along the back wall, peas have been planted as well as some purple-green beans. There is also going to be a small sport for mixed greens to grow under the window to the left.</p>
<p>In the raised bed so far arugula, breakfast radish, turnips and carrots have been seeded. The garlic and onion sets are already Â poking through the soil.</p>
<p><img alt="Openconcept's rain barrel sitting below the eves trough down spout." src="https://openconcept.ca/sites/openconcept/files/water_barrel_2014.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /></p>
<p style="width: 801px;">We also have a rain barrel set up.</p>
<p style="width: 801px;">Anyway, I thought I would let the world know a little more of what we are all about and what we are up to here at OC. I will try and post a few updates as the season progresses with some nice photos of delicious veggies growing. Happy spring planting everyone!</p>
<p style="width: 801px;">Cheers,</p>
