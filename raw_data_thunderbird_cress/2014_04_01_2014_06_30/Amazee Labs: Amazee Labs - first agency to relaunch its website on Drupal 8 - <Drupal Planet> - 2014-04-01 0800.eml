<p>Today we are proud to announce that <a href="http://amazeelabs.com">amazeelabs.com</a>, our main website, has been re-launched ON DRUPAL 8.</p>
<p>After countless hours of emotional debate we came to the conclusion that we required a bold move to communicate our position as Switzerland’s #1 Drupal agency. To put this straight we actually are the proud owners of the first company web presence on Drupal 8 - on the entire web!</p>
<p>We strongly believe that a website isn't the final destination after all, it’s just the medium for the creation and promotion of a site’s content.</p>
<p>Gregory Gerhardt, Managing Director and Founder of Amazee Labs, commented: ”<em>For too long our brilliant design has fought an uphill battle against <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.393250840715321.94960.166327383407669&amp;type=3">the evil work of copycats</a>. Our new website design shall rest uncopied - simple, authentic, close to its roots."</em></p>
<p>We hope you like our new face.</p>
