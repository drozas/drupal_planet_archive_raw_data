    <p>The last week three of us from Cocomore went to the little town of Szeged in Hungary around 175km south east of Budapest.</p>

<p>The DevDays were all about developing <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term138"><dfn title="Drupal can be thought of as many things, a content management framework (CMF), content management system (CMS), and as a community. The name derives from the Flemish/Dutch word for “drop” (“druppel”), which heralds back to an accidental registration of drop.org, instead of dorp.org ('Dorp' is the Dutch word for “village”).">Drupal</dfn></a> 8 further and enhance drupal.org. The only topic was contributing to Drupal in the one way or the other. Whatever you are, either a developer, a <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term197"><dfn title="A themer is a member of the Drupal community who is interested in or engages in “theming”, the activity of writing Drupal themes. As with other Drupal community roles, there are often few clear distinctions separating a “themer” from a “coder” or “site builder”. (See theme.)">themer</dfn></a>, a <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term188"><dfn title="A “site builder” is someone who plans and builds websites based on the Drupal core and (usually) additional contrib modules and themes. Being a “site builder” and being interested in materials for site builders and administrators does not mean that you might not also wear other “community role” hats from time to time. Many people who might primarily build sites from existing modules also write and maintain modules, themselves (so are “coders”), manage a live Drupal site (so are “administrators”), adjust their templates and CSS (so are “themers”), try to build enthusiasm about Drupal in people they meet (so are “Drupal evangelists”), etc. The term is primarily used to describe the kind of material covered in a book, in tutorials, training sessions, or presentations: it tends to mean “no heavy coding” (but expect some possibly complex user interfaces and to tweak settings).">site builder</dfn></a>, a devop or a business man, everyone has his/her part in this amazing community and everyone found a spot where he/she could help to foster Drupal further.</p> <p><a href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/blog/drupaldevdays-szeged-2014" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
