    <div class="field field-name-field-summary field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>As you may have read last week, we're starting up a Drupal 8 CX initiative which will feature a site for tracking the status of Drupal 8 module ports.</p>
<p>We'll be displaying a curated list of modules that we've identified as priorities for Drupal 8. But in order for others to build their own site to track their own priorities, we're building the site using an install profile.</p>
<p>Because I'm using an automated phing task to 'burn and reinstall' the site on a regular basis, I needed a simple lightweight solution for default content - for things like blocks (using bean) and basic nodes.</p>
<p>Read-on to see my approach.</p>
