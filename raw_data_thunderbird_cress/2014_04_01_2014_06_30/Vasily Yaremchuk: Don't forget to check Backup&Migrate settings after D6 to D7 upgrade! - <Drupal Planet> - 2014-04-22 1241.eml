    <!-- google_ad_section_start --><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Several days ago we upgraded simple Drupal 6 site to Drupal 7. After core upgrade process was finished we turned on all necessary modules such as Admin menu and Backup &amp; Migrate.</p>
<p>Some features required custom update by scripts and some manual work, we made backup before this activity.<br />
... something went wrong and we go back by restoring DB via Backup&amp;Migrate module and site wend down :-(  </p>
<p>When we took a look on DB backup script we found that there was empty dump with the structure of some tables.<br />
So as a result the data in several tables was killed.</p>
<p>When we repeated upgrade process again and took a look on Backup&amp;Migrate advanced settings we were shocked</p>
<p> <img src="/sites/default/files/bm.png" alt="incorrect table exclude settings" title="incorrect table exclude settings" /></p>
<p>By some reason all tables was excluded from backup. </p>
<p>After we align B&amp;M settings backup became works correctly :-)</p>
<p>The main idea of this post due to automatic upgrade process you should double check settings of contributed modules, upgrade can make them different according initial state. </p>
<p>And, of course, backups is necessary part of site development activity but you should be sure that your backups correct. </p>
