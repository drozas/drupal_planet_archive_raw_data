In this presentation, Paul McKibben will describe several warning signs that you have outgrown your CMS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are &nbsp;you jumping through hoops because your CMS editorial workflow has not changed with your business?</li>
<li>Can your site adequately serve your increasing mobile audience?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">From poor end user experience to lack of digital marketing support, understanding your current issues and knowing the capabilities of today’s CMSes will help you make a case for updating your CMS. And if you aren’t encountering issues now, this presentation will also offer strategies for keeping your CMS current so you do not prematurely face a major upgrade.</p>
