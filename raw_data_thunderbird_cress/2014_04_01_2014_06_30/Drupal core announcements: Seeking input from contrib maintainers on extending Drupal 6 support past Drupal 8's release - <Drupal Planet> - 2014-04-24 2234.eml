    <p>Over in <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2136029">#2136029 : Decide if and how to extend D6 security support 12 months past an 8.0.0 release</a> there's been a very lively discussion on how to deal with the situation of having ~200K active Drupal 6 sites with Drupal 8 on its way. We're trying to strike a balance between allowing site owners and module developers ample time to migrate away from Drupal 6, while at the same time not unreasonably burdening Drupal's contributor community.</p>
<p>The latest proposal there by Dries is to extend support <em>for security fixes only</em> for Drupal 6 until one year past Drupal 8's release (or 8.2.0 in the new world order), in order to allow time for a viable migration path from D6 =&gt; D8 to materialize. We're actively seeking input from contrib maintainers on this proposal.</p>
<p>Note: the discussion is long, but the issue summary is up to date, so hopefully allows you to save some time. :)</p>
