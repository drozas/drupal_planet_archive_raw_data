    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>A new look for the <a href="https://gladcamp.org">Greater Los Angeles Area Drupal Camp</a> has been unveiled. “VLADCamp” is the new name of the conference, co-organized by Greater Los Angeles Drupal organizing team member Christefano Reyes, who announced the name as it epitomizes the goals for the organization moving forward.</p>
<p>“GLADCamp was originally envisioned as being the Drupal community's marquee event of the year that heavily focuses on the needs of non-profits, education and civic engagement. After trying 'Drupal for Good' this year, we decided that 'Drupal for Evil' would be more fun,” he explained.</p>
<p>This marks a major shift in strategy for the user group, which for nearly 4 years has provided Drupal resources, including its <a href="https://drupal.la/resources/business-directory">Business Directory</a> and <a href="https://drupal.la/resources/governance-policy">Governance Policy</a>, and events, including this year's inaugural <a href="https://gladcamp.org">GLADCamp</a> conference.</p>
<p>"It's difficult growing a brand that's known for so many different things, such as meetups, job fairs, coworking days, study group sessions, workshops, code sprints and conferences," he said. "Now we stand for just one thing: Evil. We think our members will appreciate this simplification. Besides, being completely transparent and accountable is too hard."</p>
<p>According to Holly Ross, executive director of the Drupal Association, a non-profit whose mission is to foster and promote the Drupal software and community, "There is currently no other Drupal user group on our radar who is so blatantly dedicated to this behavior. We've been monitoring several user groups that have little transparency, little accountability or little consistency, but this is the first time we've seen a user group without all three," she said in a phone interview. "We're continuing to monitor the situation."</p>
<p>The VLADCamp organizing team is delighted with the impact of its new name and logo, which has been developed in consultation with Acquio, based in Burlington, Massachusetts. "We enjoy working with forward-thinking organizations who can pivot and provide value to underserved markets," said Acquio CMO Tom Wentworth, who featured VLADCamp as a successful launch partner of its content personalization service, Acquio Escalator.</p>
