It was an amazing event full of amazing people and valuable sessions. For those of you who know me, I typically spend a lot of time in the hallways just talking with and meeting new people, however I did attempt to attend some sessions and the calibre of sessions being presented was ridiculously high. The PHP community that attends these events is really obviously close knit. It was a bit like going to a large regional Drupal event.</p></div>
