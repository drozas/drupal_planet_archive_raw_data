<p>The latest couple of DrupalÂ websites I have worked on have been incredibly fulfilling to me as a front-end developer in that they aren't <strong>bogging themselves down with ridiculous old browser support</strong>.</p>

<p>We are using progressive enhancement of course, so these browsers still have the same functionality, but don't get to have all the sexy flourishes. These are mostly done using CSS3, something that if your browser doesn't support, you probably don't deserve anyway.</p></div></div></div>
