<p>About a week ago, our DrupalCon Latin American selection team reached out to the community for RFP submissions. We received a number of colorful, lively and fun submissions from several regions, and had a wonderful time evaluating each proposal. Thank you to all who submitted thoughtful and exciting work.<br /><br />
	On Tuesday, the team met to discuss the RFPs. During this process we discussed at length the designs submitted and unanimously landed on two semi-finalists.  We took the opportunity to interview both designers.</p>
<p>And our new designer is...Filipe Riach (feliperiach) of Bogota, Colombia! Filipe has experience working independently and on a team to produce sophisticated and unique designs, and we know his work will be a wonderful addition to DrupalCon Latin America. You can find more information on Filipe on <a href="http://riach.co/index.html">his website</a>. <br /><br />
	For those who have been following the selection process, you may be aware that Filipe is employed by the event’s fiscal sponsor SeeD. We want to make it absolutely clear that Fillipe’s selection was not influenced by this fact; the selection was unanimous on the committee and SeeD CEO Aldibier Morales recused himself from reviewing or providing input on Filipe’s entry.</p>
<p>Again, thank you to all who submitted design work for this project and thank you to our enthusiastic local team working hard to create a memorable DrupalCon Latin America. Stay tuned for more information soon.<br /><br />
