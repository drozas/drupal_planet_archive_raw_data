    <h2 id="new">What's new with Drupal 8?</h2>
<p>This week saw the release of Drupal 8 alpha 11 and two major patches - one adding PSR-4 autoloading support and another containing the Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 migration path.<br />
The PSR-4 patch added PSR-4 support alongside PSR-0 but it is planned to remove PSR-0 support for module classes before the first beta. We will continue to support PSR-0 for external libraries provided by modules. For more information read <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2246699">the change record</a>.<br />
The Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 migrate path was a huge patch, congratulations to all those involved. For more information keep watching This week in Drupal Core and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/core">Core group</a>. You can take it for a spin with the <a class="freelinking external" href="http://github.org/drush-ops/drush">latest version of drush</a> and <code>drush migrate-manifest</code>.</p>
<h2 id="release">Where's Drupal 8 at in terms of release?</h2>
<h3>Just last week!</h3>
<p>Last week, we fixed 12 critical issues and 16 major issues, and opened 10 criticals and 16 majors. That puts us overall at <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">118 release-blocking critical issues</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=15&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=300&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">517 major issues</a>.</p>
<p>7 beta-blocking issues were fixed last week. There are still <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=beta+blocker">28 of 165 beta blockers</a> that must be resolved before we can <a href="http://buytaert.net/the-next-step-for-drupal-8-is-a-beta">release a Drupal 8 beta</a>.</p>
<h3>How close are we to Beta 1?</h3>
<p>It's the end of April, and we are down to just 28 beta-blocking issues. For context, here's how that count has changed over the course of 2014. We started 2014 with 140 known beta blockers and missing change records combined, with 123 of those issues still unresolved. We've identified additional beta-blocking issues along the way, so as we get closer, the picture becomes more complete. In total, we've already fixed 137 beta blockers and completed more than 70 missed change records. The 28 issues that remain are a fraction of more than 200 total.</p>
<p><img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/beta_blockers_400.png" alt="A chart showing the number of total known beta-blocking issues since January 1, 2014 and the number of these that were unresolved each week." /></p>
<p>That said, we <strong>need your help</strong>. Many of the beta blockers that remain include significant changes, and the community's support and focus on these issues now will pay off at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlRKD0XsivA1dEYzMVl1cERvYUpXWDNscm8zNlpZeEE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0">DrupalCon Austin sprints</a> and after. Or, help with one of the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/419403">approachable tasks for beta 1</a> we shared last week. (Also see the "Where  can I help?" section below.)</p>
<h3>...So then when is it released?</h3>
<p>We release the first Drupal 8 release candidate when there are 0 critical issues remaining. Right now there are 118 (including the 28 top-priority beta blockers). The number of criticals has been dropping steadily since DrupalCon Prague thanks to <strong>900 Drupal 8 patch contributors</strong> during that timeframe alone. (In total, 2035 people have contributed to Drupal 8 patches over the past three years!)</p>
<p><img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/critcals_400_0.png" alt="A chart showing the number of unresolved critical issues since March 2011 peaking at 157 in September 2013 and then dropping" /></p>
<p>That still looks like a lot of remaining criticals -- and it is. However, when we compare it to the total work that's already been done in the cycle, including <strong>more than 700 critical issues already fixed</strong>, it becomes clear we are in the final phase of Drupal 8's development. (Yep... keep scrolling...)</p>
<p><img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/criticals_with_total_400_0.jpg" alt="A chart showing the unresolved criticals for Drupal 8 compared to the much higher total of about 850 known criticals since 2011" /></p>
<p>If you're as eager to build amazing things with Drupal 8 as we are, please devote what resources you can to resolving the remaining release blockers, or <a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/drupal/">support the indefatigable contributors who continue to shape Drupal 8 directly</a>.</p>
<h2 id="help">Where can I help?</h2>
<h3 id="top">Top criticals to hit this week</h3>
<p>Each week, we check with core maintainers and contributors for the "extra critical" criticals that are blocking other work. These issues are often tough problems with a long history. If you're familiar with the problem space of one of these issues and have the time to dig in, help drive it forward by reviewing, improving, and testing its patch, and by making sure the issue's summary is up to date and any API changes are documented with a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/402688">draft change record</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2116363">#2116363: Unified repository of field definitions (cache + API)</a>. Please help review this essential step to complete the Drupal 8 Entity Field API.</li>
