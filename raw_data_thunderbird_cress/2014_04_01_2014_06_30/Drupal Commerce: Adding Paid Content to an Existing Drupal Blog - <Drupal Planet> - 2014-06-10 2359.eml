With some modules and a bit of time, you can transform any Drupal 7 site into a revenue generation engine â€” no matter if you are selling physical products, file downloads, or just wanting to monetize digital content or access.  The ability to simply enable commerce on an existing site is <em>very</em> powerful and can open up opportunities that you might not have considered.</p>
<p>One of those possibilities is paid content. This post will walk you through adding paid content to an existing blog site using two modules from our Digital Commerce Suite: Commerce License (CL) and Commerce License Billing (CLB). At DrupalCon 2014 in Austin, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOg_uWiC5MY">second half of Commerce by Example</a>, we walked through the process of setting up a blog. The instructions and the demo site archive are here (link above) so you can walk through at your own pace.</p>
