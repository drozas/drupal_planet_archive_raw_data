DrupalCon Amsterdam is coming soon, and I can’t wait to welcome the Drupal community to this wonderful city. The conference is shaping up to be an absolutely incredible experience.</p>
<p>The local Dutch Drupal community has been hard at work coming up with a huge number of fun and cultural activities. From the <a href="http://tourdedrupal.drupalgardens.com/">Tour de Drupal</a> bike ride from London to Amsterdam, to the Drupal bar crawl up and down the canals; DrupalCon Amsterdam is going to be a great place to learn more about Drupal, celebrate the community, and have a fantastic time.</p>
<p>Make sure you buy your ticket and <a href="https://www.rai-hotelservice.com/compass/external/index.cfm?meeting_ID=1887&amp;Meeting_ID_Code=883368083&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_source=&amp;utm_campaign=">reserve your hotel room as soon as possible</a>, so you can get the best prices. In the coming weeks, we’ll be rolling out more information about the convention, sponsorship opportunities, and more.</p>
