In this connection we recently took an interesting newsletter sending project from one of our potential clients who is doing relatively big in Internet marketing.</p>
<p>In brief, we were asked for a custom system for sending out newsletter emails, based on Drupal. Tentatively 600k emails to be sent per month. A newsletter list shall have up to 80k users and limited to a couple of lists to begin with.</p></div></div></div>
