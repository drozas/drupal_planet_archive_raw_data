	<a href="https://www.drupalfund.us/users/tess-flynn" target="_blank">Tess Flynn</a> is a valuable member of the community that supports <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-8.0" target="_blank">Drupal 8</a>. She <em>“is pouring countless hours in porting flag.module to Drupal 8 and in doing so test driving new the D8 APIs,”</em> wrote S. Corlosquet on Tess´s feedback wall. Flag module 8.x will have the benefit of uncovering bugs in Drupal 8 early so they can be fixed before D8 is released.</div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	 </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	<strong>Why the effort to get there?!</strong></div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	 </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	Tess wants to provide a working Drupal 8 version of Flag module as close as possible to the Drupal 8 release date. The radical changes in Drupal 8 have required an extensive rewrite of Flag module code. <em>“While I've made significant progress on IRC, I need the high-bandwidth communication with core developers that only in-person conversations provide,”</em>  says Tess Flynn.</div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	 </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	Therefore she needed help to attend <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupalcon held in Austin on June 2nd, 2014</a> so that she could get Flag to the finish line. Besides, her goal is to use this as an opportunity to educate others on Drupal 8, as well as raise awareness and excitement; also to catch any issues in core that only contributing developers will experience. She has already caught several core bugs earlier. </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	 </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	Tess has really good reasons to get there. Also <em>“the community would definitely benefit from being able to help her get to Austin,” </em>mentioned Damien McKenna on Tess´s feedback wall.</div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	 </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	<strong>We have perfect news to tell you!</strong></div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	 </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	Tess Flynn will provide a D8 version of Flag module, she will also educate others in Drupal 8 while catching any issues on core because she <strong>GOES</strong> to Drupalcon Austin 2014!!! </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	 </div>
<div class="rtejustify">
	The project “<a href="https://www.drupalfund.us/project/send-flag-drupal-8-developer-drupalcon" target="_blank">Send Flag for Drupal 8 Developer to Drupalcon!</a>” succeeded. Collectively, 21 funders donated 104% of the funding goal. It equated to 1040 dollars and that´s enough to send her to Drupalcon Austin 2014 to finish her mission. Thanks everybody!</div>
