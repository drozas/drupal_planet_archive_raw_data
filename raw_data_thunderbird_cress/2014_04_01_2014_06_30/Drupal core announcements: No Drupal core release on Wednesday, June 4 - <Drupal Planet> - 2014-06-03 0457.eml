    <p>The monthly Drupal core bug fix release window is scheduled for this Wednesday. However, the last release was <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-7.28">a month ago</a> and this is DrupalCon week, so there won't be a bug fix release this month.  Enjoy DrupalCon (those of you who are there)!</p>
<p>Upcoming release windows include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, June 18 (security release window)</li>
<li>Wednesday, July 2 (bug fix release window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on Drupal core release windows, see the documentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info#when">release timing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173280">security releases</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/260803">discussion</a> that led to this policy being implemented.</p>
