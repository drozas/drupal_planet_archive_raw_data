The organizer team is still energized after our experience putting together <a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Dev Days Europe 2014</a> in Szeged, Hungary between 24 and 30 March. </p>
<p>Several people asked about details and we wanted to document the event for future event organizers to share what worked best for us. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6xsrc5BVkagNVpoeEFDZy1RMVk/edit">We prepared a report</a> for you so if you experienced Drupal Dev Days Szeged, you can look behind the curtain a bit, or if you heard about it, you can see what we did to pull off an event like this. If you were not there and did not hear about it, we included several feedback references as well to give you an idea.</p>
<p>Do you want to see tweets and articles like those about your event? Read the report for our tips! </p>
<p>We definitely did not do everything right but we hope we can help people learn from the things we did right.</p>
<p>Excuse us if the report is a bit too long, we attempted to pack useful information to every single sentence to make reading it worth your time. <a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/contact">Send questions and comments to the team</a>.</p>
