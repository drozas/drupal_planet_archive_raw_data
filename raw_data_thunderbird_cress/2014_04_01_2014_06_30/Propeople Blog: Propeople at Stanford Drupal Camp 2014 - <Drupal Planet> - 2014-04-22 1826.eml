Stanford University is one of the biggest advocates of Drupal in higher-education, and is home to an active and passionate Drupal community. Hosted on the world famous (and too-gorgeous-to-put-into-words) Stanford campus, the Stanford Drupal Camp is an annual event focused on Drupal and the state of Drupal at the university (where thousands of websites are powered by the CMS). Propeople has participated in the event the past few years, and we've had the pleasure to work on a wide variety of Stanford projects in the same amount of time. These include the <a href="/clients/stanford-graduate-school-business">Stanford Graduate School of Business</a>, <a href="/clients/slac">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a>, <a href="/clients/stanford-student-affairs">Stanford Student Affairs</a>, <a href="/clients/riverwalk-jazz">Riverwalk Jazz</a>, and many others. </p><p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Stanford Drupal Camp featured a great line-up of sessions and talks all day Friday and Saturday, ranging from the simple to the complex. The talks focused on a variety of topics, from site building to Agile and Scrum methodology to specific Drupal use cases in higher education. As you can expect at any Drupal camp, more casual BoFs and lightning talks were interspersed throughout the conference.</span></p><p dir="ltr">We were happy to have the packed schedule include two sessions presented by one of Propeople’s own Drupal experts, <a href="/blog/author/yuriy-gerasimov">Yuriy Gerasimov</a>, on Saturday. Yuriy’s first session was titled “CI and Other Tools for Feature Branch Development”, aimed at helping developers and organizations implement feature-branch workflow. The second was “Local Development with Vagrant”, which, as you might have guessed from the title, was all about the benefits of using Vagrant to spin up local virtual machines with the same settings on different platforms.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"><img alt="Propeople at Stanford Drupal Camp" class="media-element file-default" data-file_info="%7B%22fid%22:%223391%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22Propeople%20at%20Stanford%20Drupal%20Camp%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22%22,%22field_tags%5Bund%5D%22:%22%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Yuriy_Propeople_1_0.jpg" style="line-height: 1.538em;" typeof="foaf:Image" /></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Yuriy_Propeople_2_0.jpg" alt="Yuriy Gerasimov, one of Propeople&amp;#039;s Drupal experts" /></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Overall, the many sessions, BoFs, and lightning talks provided Stanford staff, faculty, students, and developers (from the university and beyond) with plenty of great information.</span></p><p>In addition to the full session schedule, Stanford Drupal Camp featured plenty of opportunities for those at the event to enjoy each other’s company, catch up, and engage in some great conversation about every attendee’s favorite topic...Drupal! As a technology partner to more than a dozen Stanford departments and institutions, Propeople has learned first hand how great the Stanford community is, and it was a treat to have some of our team on campus to join in on the fun at Stanford Drupal Camp. We’ll be looking forward to next year!</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/tags/drupal" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Drupal</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/tags/drupal-camp" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Drupal camp</a></div><div class="field-item even"><a href="/tags/stanford" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Stanford</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-drupal-planet field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Check this option to include this post in Planet Drupal aggregator:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/drupal/planet" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">planet</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-topics field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Topics:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/topics/community-events" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Community &amp; Events</a></div></div></div>
