<ul>
<li><strong>Registration</strong> literally took seconds. Although I wasn't thrilled about the shirt color this year (cranberry/purple), the registration process was smooth and efficient</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries'</a> keynote</strong> was pretty good. I especially liked how he reinforced the point that <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal 8</a> is positioning itself to be relevant in a rapidly-changing web landscape. I would have liked to see a deeper technical breakdown, as opposed to the high level problem/solution talk, but overall it was good.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</a> session</strong> was pretty eye opening. While I haven't used DI in Drupal/PHP Projects, I have used it in <a href="http://www.mariocasciaro.me/dependency-injection-in-node-js-and-other-architectural-patterns">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di">Angular.js</a>. I'm super excited to embrace DI in D8 now.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch</strong> was nice...although I regret the second cookie.</li>
<li>The <strong>session on <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/drupal-8-theme-system-hooktheme-twig-template">Twig in Drupal 8</a></strong> was okay but very short. In fact, it was so short that I was stunned when I heard the words "Thank you" at the conclusion of their presentation. Either way, I did learn a little about Twig in D8 which was cool.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/here%E2%80%99s-drupal-tonight-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon">The Tonight Show</a> session</strong> was amazing! It was so awesome to see an example of using Drupal as an API to deliver content to connected front-ends (ie <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>). It was also very confirming as we're currently building a set of connected front-ends using a very similar approach (hint hint, we're using <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Dinner</strong> at <a href="http://stubbsaustin.com/">Stubbs BBQ</a> was phenomenal! The spinach was the kind of spicy/creamy that makes you want to slap yo momma!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tomorrow (Wednesday)</h3>

<p>Tomorrow, I'm looking forward to more networking and sessions.  If you live in or around the St. Louis area, and are at DrupalCon, feel free say hey. We're always looking for other developers in the St. Louis region to work with and I'd love to connect!</p>
