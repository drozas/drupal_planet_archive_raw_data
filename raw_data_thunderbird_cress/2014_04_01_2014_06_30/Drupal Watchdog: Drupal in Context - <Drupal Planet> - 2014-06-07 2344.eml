              <h4>The Way to Drupal Answers Isn't Always Clear; Here's How to Find It</h4>
<p>They say “everyone starts as a beginner,” but that’s not quite true. Pianists easily apply their training to transition into conducting or composing; carpenters and stonemasons become sculptors. Likewise, former programmers intuit Drupal's inner workings on sight. Some beginners simply start out “more equal than others” — leaving the rest of us scrambling to catch up.</p>
<p>Commercial software incorporates the cost of training, documentation, and support into the product’s price: Without an easy “on-ramp,” the product will fail to gain new adherents and, eventually, fade away. Core Drupal, as a free, open source product, lacks this support-system advantage, so help must come either from volunteers or from the third-party market. Alas, volunteers are sometimes unreliable — or unavailable when needed — and the third-party market requires money. And so a “knowledge gap” has developed between those who hold information and those who need it.</p>
<p>But it's not hopeless, because the Drupal ecosystem has grown and diversified so much that those two sources of help can now serve just about everyone, including you — if you know where to look.</p>
<h3>Getting Answers Fast</h3>
<p>When problems grind your project to a halt, speed is of the essence. Your best bet for free, emergency support is the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="php geshifilter-php">#drupal-support</code></span> channel of Internet Relay Chat (IRC), staffed by helpful volunteers. Sadly, the demand for help there far outstrips the supply, so many questions go unanswered.</p>
<p>More reliable are the commercial offerings. These are sometimes provided as part of a subscription program, the best-known of which is the Acquia Network, where direct, ticket-based support starts at $2,500 per year. (Forum-based support is available as part of cheaper packages.) But Acquia is far from the only player, and <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-services">http://drupal.org/drupal-services</a> lists over 100 companies that offer some form of support.</p>        </div>
