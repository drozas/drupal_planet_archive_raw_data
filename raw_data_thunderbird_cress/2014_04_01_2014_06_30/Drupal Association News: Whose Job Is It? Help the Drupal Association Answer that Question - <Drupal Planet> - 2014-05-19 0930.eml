    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img alt="" src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/6955571350_706cb9b597_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 179px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px; float: left;" />A while ago I shared that we are trying to better understand <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/content/defining-our-roles-drupal-community">who plays what role in the Drupal Community</a>. A small team of Association Board and staff have done some interviews with about 20 community members and now we want to get a broader understanding - what are the issues that concern you, and who should be doing the work to address them?</p>
<p>We're reaching out to our most active community members to ask you to complete a survey about who you think should be doing what in our community.</p>
<h3>
	<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Y7YCKTL">Take the Survey</a></h3>
<p>How the Drupal community and Association staff (as part of that community) work together to support the Drupal project is a question that we are excited to come to some agreement around. Your participation in this survey will help us answer some of <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/content/defining-our-roles-drupal-community" target="blank">the questions we have raised</a> and create a more productive and meaningful path forward.</p>
<p>We would like you to share with us your answers to the following questions about the various aspects of the Drupal project and community:</p>
<ul><li>
		Who decides? Which person or entity gets to make the final call about what direction to take?</li>
	<li>
		Who does the work? For every decision that is made, who ensures that the work is complete?</li>
	<li>
		Who is consulted? Who needs to be heard before a decision is made and/or throughout implementation?</li>
</ul><p>The work of the community is incredibly broad, so there are lots of places we need feedback. However, we didn't want this survey to be overly-long, so you can pick and choose which areas of work you would like to inform.</p>
<p>For each area of work, we want to you to tell us how various groups of people should be engaged. The audiences are:</p>
