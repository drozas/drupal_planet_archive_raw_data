<p>Patching software is a common practice in open source software that enables developers to fix bugs and implement features within their projects, independent of the upstream softwareâ€™s development cycle. The offset of this approach is that it can become cumbersome to maintain and re-apply patches as the upstream software continues to fix bugs, implement features and fix security vulnerabilities.</p></div>
