A good Drupaler can find work on some of the most notable sites in the world next to other great minds and in good working conditions. Drupal is taking the world by storm, converting government agencies, Fortune 500s and many more on a daily basis. But this popularity has come at a price. The existing talent pool is just too limited to support Drupal’s popularity without serious investment in developing a greater pool of talent, and that something the existing community has got to own and make happen.</p></div>
