As a member of the <a href="http://stichtingdrupal.nl/" rel="nofollow">Stichting Drupal Nederland</a> I have been (co) organising our DrupalCamps called "DrupalJam" for some time now. Last year we hired a soccer stadium for the the DrupalJam and this year we are at a very relaxing location at the water: <a href="http://www.Innstyle.nl" rel="nofollow">InnStyle</a><br />

This year we are working hard to make sure we will have an even better conference than last year. So far, we are on track on making sure we will. :-)</p>
<p>The first keynote speaker is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancilla_Tilia" rel="nofollow">Ancillia Tilia</a>, former fetish model now known in the Netherlands a advocate on digital rights. She has been active in <a href="https://www.bof.nl/" rel="nofollow">BIts Of Freedom</a>, the Dutch equivelant of the EFF and the "<a href="https://piratenpartij.nl/" rel="nofollow">pirateparty</a>" in Amsterdam. The second keynote is from <a href="http://tulpinteractive.com/" rel="nofollow">Jan Willem</a> Tulp who creates astonishing data visualisations. Take for example the work descibed on <a href="http://tulpinteractive.com/projects/amsterdam-campus/" rel="nofollow">on this page</a> and burn some CPU cycles while <a href="http://tulpinteractive.com/amsterdam-campus/" rel="nofollow">flying</a> in WebGL over over Amsterdam.<br />

<p>The featured speakers include Jeroen Tjepkema on web performance, Vincent van Scherpenseel on UX, Iacobien Riezenbosh (State of the web) and Sander Spierenbug (Ethical hacker at KPN, the largest telco in the Netherlands). Apart from these there is a full program on <a href="http://www.drupaljam.nl/#block-block-15" rel="nofollow">the site</a> and it includes a Question and Answer session via the internet with Dries Buytaert. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2441/3964405342_a71178d518_z.jpg">Always wanted to ask a question (even if you are not coming to the DrupalJam or are from the Netherlands?), but were afraid to ask? Now is your chance. Do <a href="http://www.drupaljam.nl/qa-dries-buytaert" rel="nofollow">send in</a> your hair raising questions to Dries! If you are stuck in Drupal, we also have a gurubar where the best minds of the Dutch Drupal community will help you out on the spot.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the sponsors and if you are around in the Netherlsands, be sure to <a href=" https://drupaljam.paydro.net/" rel="nofollow">buy your ticket</a> for 29 euros (30 if you become a member of the <a href="http://stichtingdrupal.nl/" rel="nofollow">Stichting Drupal Nederland</a>).

If you can't make it, you can follow the event at <a href="http://eventifier.com/event/drupaljam/popular" rel="nofollow">eventifier</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/DrupalJam" rel="nofollow">@drupaljam</a></p>
<p>Last thing, friend <a href="http://www.sevensheaven.nl/" rel="nofollow">Metin Seven</a> made an artwork with Druplicon that we printed on a <a href="https://twitter.com/bertboerland/status/459645161254187008/photo/1" rel="nofollow">1 meter high canvas</a>. Attendees can bid on this artwork (new office? must have! :-) ) during the conference.</p>
<p>Organising these events is always a lot of work but with a <a href="http://www.drupaljam.nl/colofon" rel="nofollow">great team</a> it is neither "a lot" nor "work". Thanks team! Peace.</p>
