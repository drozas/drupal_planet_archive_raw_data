    So we got an old windows computer setup to do the exam. Could install teh software needed, launched Sentiel to setup up my profile, and I was told to write my name to test my speed on the keyboard. So I entered my name, and “WRONG!”. Got a password error sign. Now I got confused, I was not told enter my password. But ok, so I entered my password. “WRONG”. I tried to write my name again. “WRONG”. Bullocks.  </p>
<div class="field-ns-blog-post-body clearfix">
            <div class="field-item even"> <p>I tried to contact support from Sentiel application. A chat window opened, and I got a welcome message from the support, nice. So I started to write  my question about the password warning error thing. I did a typo in the question, hit backspace, and Abrakadabra, my screen got tilted, and were now laying on the side. WTF. I guess some software error and mismatch on the Windows computers soft- or hardware. I guess software, you know, it’s Windows.<br /><br />Opened the control panel, got the screen on right side again, and started to write in the support chat again after starting a new session. And Abrakadabra. Tilted screen. Maybe its a feature….<br /><br />So I started thinking instead. You got to have a US-keyboard to do the test, and maybe Sentiel just doesnt love my lastname, Schirén. I suspected é here. So I changed the spelling of my last name, with and “e” instead. And yeah. That worked.<br /><br />Doing the certification text in 20 minutes, let’s see what happens.</p><p><strong>EDIT: I passed. Now I am an <em>Acquia Certified Developer</em>. But still a little bit grumpy. I will come back on the issue next week.</strong></p><p><em>Image: "Confused" by Slava</em></p> </div>
