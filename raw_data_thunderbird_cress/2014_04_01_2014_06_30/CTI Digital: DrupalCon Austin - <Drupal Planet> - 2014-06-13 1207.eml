<p>It's fair to say DrupalCon Austin was always going to be special for CTI Digital from the outset. Appointed DrupalCon 2014 design partners our team have enjoyed contributing to the overall success of the conference. CTI’s Creative Director, Rik Hopkinson designed the complete conference concept and branding encomassing signage, brochures, guides, stickers, web design, right the way through to the stage design below.</p>

<p>The pre-keynote "Calling all Drupal Super Heros" saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adrG4EOiJRk">Dries wrapped in a million critical tissues</a> and all 3300 attendees performing <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/68158920@N08/14314364116/">the ridiculous Gity Pokey</a>. It was no surprise to see Robert Douglass seizing the opportunity to don a nurses outfit complete with plaits and beard!</p>

<p>On a more serious note the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnERPdAiuSo">DriesNote</a> was a refreshing departure from the typicial state of Drupal presentation. During his keynote Dries Buytaert illustrated in how photography in the early days was a complex time consuming process with many steps. With innovation came 35mm film, then Polaroid and lately digital cameras. With each generation photography became more streamlined.</p>
<p>Looking at the way the web is evolving he sees a digital convergence and the development of what he coined the "Experience Web". He challenged the audience to consider what Drupal's future role would be and provided some predictions. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnERPdAiuSo">Watch the Keynote here</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/keynote-erynn-petersen">Erynn Petersen's keynote</a> approached the issues of diversity and inclusivity in open source and business. Saying <em>"An Open Source Project is as Healthy and Vibrant as its community"  </em>she celebrated the Drupal community as trailblazing the campaign to ensure a well rounded community<em>. I</em>ndeed DrupalCon Austin had 20% female attendees which represents a substaintial and consistent uplift.<em> </em></p>
<p><img alt="" height="517" src="http://www.ctidigital.com/sites/default/files/community-summit_1.jpg" style="line-height: 1.538em;" width="512" /></p>
<p>As a highly active member of the global community Paul contributed to the global Drupal Community Summit. A rare opportunity to meet many of the leaders we communicate with on a regular basis, the day event allowed thought leaders to share their epic wins and fails so others could learn and improve their local Drupal community, DrupalCamps, solve issues with Drupal.org and general sprint on the human side of Drupal.</p>

<p>CTI Digital commisioned Tom Oakley from <a href="http://www.tenimc.com/">Ten Integrated Marketing</a> to design a cartoon/superhero style mask of Drupal creator Dries Buytaert. We encouraged people to tweet themselves wearing the mask to #WheresDries with a chance of winning a <a href="http://vimeo.com/60307041">Makey Makey</a>.</p>
<p>Before Paul left for DrupalCon he contacted <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=wheresdries&amp;src=typd&amp;mode=photos">Drupalist around the globe</a> and invited them to join in, in a small way bringing the spirit of DrupalCon to where they lived. We should never lose sight that some people are not able to attend. It was amazing to see what contrasting lives people using Drupal lead. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/henniemartens">Hendrik Martens</a> travelled to Johanesburg to find a special location for his #WheresDries photo.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="384" src="http://www.ctidigital.com/sites/default/files/img_2696.jpg" width="512" /></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Tteller">Timo Teller</a> was the first lucky winner of a Makey Makey which we knew his kids would enjoy!</p>
<p><img alt="" height="384" src="http://www.ctidigital.com/sites/default/files/drupal-latino.jpg" width="512" /></p>
<p>As DrupalCon social media lead Paul met with the Drupal Latino team who are planning DrupalCon Bogotá. It looks like we are in for quite a party! Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/drupalconlatino">@DrupalConLatino</a> for news.</p>

<p>During the conference Cathy Theys made Paul aware that the crowdfunding initiative to develop Rules for Drupal 8 was not likely to reach it's funding deadline in just 7 days. As one of the first corporate sponsors of #D8Rules we are pleased to announce after a sustained social media campaign the $15,000 funding goal was smashed. Further phases of funding will follow. You can <a href="http://d8rules.org/">find out about Drupal8Rules here</a>.</p>

<p>So after the DrupalCon volunteers dinner Paul's work was over and our thoughts are already onto <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Amsterdam</a> where we again are developing the entrire branding, design and build of the conference marketing collateral and website. We thoroughly enjoyed contributing to helping DrupalCon "Keep Austin Weird" and we hope to meet you in Amsterdam where CTI Digital will be present in much larger numbers! </p>
