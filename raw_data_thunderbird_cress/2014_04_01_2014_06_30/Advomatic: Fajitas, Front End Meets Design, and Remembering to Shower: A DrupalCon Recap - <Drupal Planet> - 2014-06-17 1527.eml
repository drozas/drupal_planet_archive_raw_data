<p>Like many of you, the AdvoTeam hit Austin a coupe of weeks ago for <a href="https://drupal.org/drupalcon">DrupalCon 2014</a>. Now that we&rsquo;ve had some time to digest all the knowledge dropped (pun intended), we&rsquo;re sharing our favorite DrupalCon takeaways. We&rsquo;ve even included links to the DrupalCon sessions, so you can share in the joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Amanda, Front-End Developer:</h4>
<blockquote><p>
Design and front end are <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/responding-responsive-designer%E2%80%99s-guide-adapting">figuring out how to fit together</a>. Do designers need to know how to code? Should they <em>really </em>uninstall Photoshop? And while <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/my-brain-full-keeping-pace-front-end-ux-innovations">front-enders are benefiting from all the dev work</a> coming down the pipe, we&rsquo;re a bit overloaded waiting to see what emerges when the dust settles.</p>
<p>Despite our gripes, it is pretty satisfying that our teams now recognize that the front-end is infinitely more complex than it was just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was blown away that the conference attendance was 20% women! For me, that&rsquo;s an indication that the community is doing something right in terms of attracting women in ways that other softwares don&rsquo;t. Kudos!
</p></blockquote>
<h4>Monica-Lisa, Director of Web Development</h4>
<blockquote><p>
Loved the session on <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/running-distributed-drupal-shop">running a shop of remote workers</a>. The big takeaways: Be in constant, positive, fun communication with one another. Find the best tools to keep in touch. If you can&rsquo;t work all the same hours, choose a few hours a day, every day to overlap. Have a lot of trust in your people. And of course, don&rsquo;t forget to take a shower every once in a while.
</p></blockquote>
<h4>Dave, Web Development Technical Manager</h4>
<blockquote><p>
This was one of the best DrupalCons I&rsquo;ve been to. Top of the list of sessions: Adam Edgerton&rsquo;s talk on <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/oh-look-were-growing-pm-approach-scaling-teams-people-process-and-tools">scaling a dev shop</a>. This year was also one of the best <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/keynote-dries-buytaert">DriesNotes</a> (keynote by Dries Buytaert, founder and lead developer of Drupal.)</p>
<p>And in past years, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time hanging out with anyone I bumped into. But this year, I spent almost all my time with the Advoteam; going biking and swimming - we even went to Monica&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house for fajitas one night.
</p></blockquote>
<h4>Jim, Senior Web Developer</h4>
<blockquote><p>
The <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/get-involved-with-core">Core Sprint</a> was inspiring, because everyone was getting the help they needed while also giving help to others. Everyone knew different things, so as a group, we were all able to share our collective knowledge to get people set up on Drupal 8, review patches, and to commit new ones.
</p></blockquote>
<h4>Jack, Front End Developer</h4>
<blockquote><p>
Once again, Drupalcon has shown me that it&#39;s not safe (or fun) to get comfortable. &nbsp;<a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/getting-started-grunt-better-frontend-ops">The tools we use to make our work go faster and smoother</a> are constantly changing. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s all the rage this year will probably be obsolete next year. &nbsp;Don&#39;t fall in love with any one way of doing things.</p>
<p><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/my-brain-full-keeping-pace-front-end-ux-innovations">Front-end development and theming has never felt more &quot;sink or swim&quot;, and that&#39;s probably a good thing.</a> &nbsp;However, as things get more and more complicated, the single front-end developer that knows <em>everything</em> becomes more of a mythological creature. &nbsp;As new worlds of specialization open up, it becomes more important to have new specialists available.</p>
<p>Lastly, it was awesome to get some face time with the Advoteam. &nbsp;It&#39;s good for the remote team&#39;s morale, and also nice to be reminded you work with other human beings that have other things to talk about besides technical Drupal talk.
