As Drupal developers, we frequently feel the need forÂ getting the most recent database dump from live site. When I did this recently, it was relatively a big site, thought it would be nice to skip a few tables that are not essential. At least to avoid unnecessary time spent on I/O operations. This is one of the few things that I have least tried with Drush.</p></div></div></div>
