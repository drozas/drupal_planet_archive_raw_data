<p>The organizations involved with the project are the American Booksellers Association (ABA), On Demand Books (ODB), and McNally Jackson Books, an independent bookseller in New York City. We worked with McNally Jackson to provide them with technical leadership and custom module development services for a complex e-commerce, web services and hardware integration project.</p>
<p>Our challenge was twofold. First, we needed to create a way that customers could search for a digital book on the McNally Jackson website from among an ever-changing list of external sources, like Google Books, the Internet Archive and various commercial publishers.</p>
<p>Second, we needed to help the book-buying customer purchase that digital book from the website in an intuitive way, and then send that order to the bookstore — and the Espresso Book Machine — for printing, pickup and/or shipping. We've known for years that Drupal can publish to any device, but this was an opportunity for us to take Drupal where it hadn't been before.</p>
