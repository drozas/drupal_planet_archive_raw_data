  <body id="msgFeedSummaryBody" selected="false">
    <p>Last month, we released the 2.0-beta release of the Commerce iATS module, a Drupal module that leverages <a href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce">Drupal Commerce</a> and the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/03/announcing-iats-php-wrapper/">iATS Payments PHP Wrapper</a> to add support for payment processing via <a href="http://home.iatspayments.com/">iATS Payments</a>.</p>

<p>We also <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/04/refactoring-the-iats-drupal-module/">promised to deliver</a> ACH/EFT and Direct Debit payment functionality before DrupalCon Austin. It took a few long days, but we&#39;re proud to announce the release of <a href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce_iats">Commerce iATS 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>Commerce iATS 2.0 is packed with new features that allow you to fully take advantage of the services offered by iATS Payments.</p>

<h2>New Payment Methods</h2>

<p>In addition to supporting <strong>credit card payments</strong>, Commerce iATS now supports <strong>ACH/EFT</strong>, meaning your users can now make payments directly from their bank account.</p>

<p>Because iATS Payments supports international payments, we made sure that you can too. Commerce iATS 2.0 fully supports <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_debit">Direct Debit</a></strong> for the UK.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re familiar with Direct Debit, you&#39;ll know that any website offering the service is required to implement a very specific checkout process.</p>

<p>With assistance from iATS Payments, we&#39;ve done all the work for you. Commerce iATS now provides a set of <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2268891">custom checkout panes</a> for the complete Direct Debit checkout process. You don&#39;t even have to worry about the 12-day lead time on initial payments; the module figures it out and gives your users a choice of start dates.</p>

<h2>More Options for Recurring Payments</h2>

<p>Recurring payments are great for donations, which fits in with iATS Payments&#39; goal of supporting the needs of nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p>With Drupal Commerce, you always had the option of recurring payments using the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce_cardonfile">Commerce Card on File</a> module, but iATS Payments handles that for you. With Commerce iATS 2.0, you can opt to have iATS Payments bill your customers on a recurring schedule rather than have your Drupal site do all the work.</p>

<p>The Drupal Commerce order stays updated with recurring transactions thanks to iATS Payment&#39;s <a href="http://home.iatspayments.com/sites/default/files/iats_webservices_reportlink_version_4.0.pdf">ReportLink service</a>. Commerce iATS implements a cron task to pull in daily transaction reports from iATS, updating your orders in the process.</p>

<p>In addition to the new features, we took time to make the module more robust. Some of our improvements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Payment Methods Admin Page now warns of any unconfigured payment methods</li>
<li>Error handling in the checkout process is much more user-friendly</li>
<li>Payment method settings are clearer and easier to understand</li>
</ul>

<h2>See you at DrupalCon</h2>
