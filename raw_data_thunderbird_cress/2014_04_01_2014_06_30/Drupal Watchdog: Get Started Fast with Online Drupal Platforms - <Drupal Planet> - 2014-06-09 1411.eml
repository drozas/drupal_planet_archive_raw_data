<p>If you’re new to website development, the standard instructions for installing Drupal are likely to be a bit daunting. Even if you’re a seasoned pro, setting up a well-designed development environment — then tweaking it for optimal Drupal hosting — takes time and effort that you might prefer to spend on building sites.</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s a growing set of online platforms that take the muss and fuss out of Drupal site building. As well as easing development, online Drupal platforms offer a range of server-side optimizations for fast and secure site hosting. Here’s a quick rundown of some of the options, with both features and limitations of each.</p>
<h3>Drupal Gardens</h3>
<p>Want to spin up a quick Drupal 7 site? Drupal Gardens is your easiest option. Think of it as the Drupal equivalent of wordpress.com. </p>
