    <h3>Introducing... This Month in Drupal Documentation (TMIDD)</h3>
<p>Similar to "This Week in Drupal Core", the relatively new <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">Documentation Working Group (DocWG)</a> is trying out a new communication strategy: an approximately monthly post on what is happening in Drupal Documentation. We'll be posting this both to the Core and Documentation groups on groups.drupal.org, and because it is posted to Core, comments will be disabled by policy.</p>
<p>If you have comments or suggestions, please see the DocWG home page for how to contact us. Thanks!</p>
<h3>Notable Documentation Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Numerous people worked on updating Drupal 8 API tutorials: <a href="https://drupal.org/developing/api/8" title="https://drupal.org/developing/api/8">https://drupal.org/developing/api/8</a></li>
<li>hatuhay and others wrote documentation for the "League" contributed module:  <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2217333" title="https://drupal.org/node/2217333">https://drupal.org/node/2217333</a></li>
<li>Darren Oh and others wrote and updated documentation for the "Salsify" contributed module: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2235183" title="https://drupal.org/node/2235183">https://drupal.org/node/2235183</a></li>
<li>dnsopek and others wrote and update contributor documentation for the "Panoply" contributed module: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2271003" title="https://drupal.org/node/2271003">https://drupal.org/node/2271003</a></li>

<h3>Thanks for contributing!</h3>
<p>Since May 1st, 206 contributors have made 783 total revisions to Drupal documentation pages on Drupal.org. Wow, thanks everyone! 7 people made at least 30 page edits each:</p>
<ul>
<li class="first"><a href="https://drupal.org/user/30772">Darren Oh</a> (49 revisions)</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org//u/tvn">tvn</a> (44 revisions)</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org//u/jhodgdon">jhodgdon</a> (44 revisions)</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org//u/lolandese">lolandese</a> (34 revisions)</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org//u/xjm">xjm</a> (34 revisions)</li>

<li><a href="https://drupal.org//user/620770">drupalshrek</a> (30 revisions)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there were many many commits to Drupal Core and contributed projects that improved documentation -- these are hard to count, because many commits combine code and documentation -- but they are greatly appreciated too!</p>
<h3>Documentation Priorities</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1005304">Current documentation priorities page</a> is always a good place to look to figure out what to work on, and has been updated recently.</p>
<p>If you're new to contributing to documentation, these projects may seem a bit overwhelming -- so why not try out a <a href="https://drupal.org/contributor-tasks/writers">New contributor task</a> to get started?</p>

<h3>Report from the Working Group</h3>
<p>The DocWG was formed in April, and has been having meetings every two weeks to define how we'll work, and our Goals, Priorities, and Policies. In our first two months of meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>We decided to meet for an hour every two weeks, for the time being.</li>
<li>We set up communications procedures, which are listed on our DocWG home page.</li>
<li>We made a definitive list of Goals, which are posted on <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals" title="https://drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals">https://drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals</a></li>
<li>We're looking carefully through all of the suggestions and ideas the community has had in the past for how to improve documentation policies, procedures, and tools (and achieve our goals). We will eventually make a list of priorities. This is in progress.
</li><li>We've been talking to other individuals and working groups where our goals and responsibilities overlap, such as talking to representatives of the International Drupal community to figure out what our goals and priorities should be in the area of translating documentation.</li>
<li>We've been updating the section on how to contribute to documentation at: <a href="https://drupal.org/contribute/documentation" title="https://drupal.org/contribute/documentation">https://drupal.org/contribute/documentation</a> (there is more to be done there)</li>
<li>We decided not to have a single "documentation team leader", and instead let the DocWG provide leadership</li>
<li>We are deemphasizing the concept of the "documentation team" (which sounds like you have to be a docs expert or special team member to help out), and are instead trying to promote the concept of having the Drupal community as a whole take ownership of the documentation, and individuals take "maintainership" of parts of the documentation (more coming on that in the future).</li>
<li>And... We decided to make these monthly TMIDD posts, which I'm putting into action today!</li>
</ul>
