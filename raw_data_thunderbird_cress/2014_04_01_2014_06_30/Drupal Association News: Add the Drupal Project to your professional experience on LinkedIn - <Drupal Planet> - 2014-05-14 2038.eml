Maintaining modules, patching bugs, organizing camps and responding to issues in the issue queue can be a lot of work, and now, you can get professional recognition on LinkedIn for your efforts.</p>
<p>There is now a company page for the Drupal Project available to anyone who wants to cite their work with Drupal as professional experience on LinkedIn. This is a great opportunity to get recognition from employers and colleagues for your hard work, and to signal to future employers that you’re a Drupal expert and/or contributor.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/drupal-project" target="_blank">LinkedIn page here</a>. To add it to your work experience, treat it like you would any other company: edit your profile, and when you type in Drupal Project under “Experience,” it should pop up.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any questions or feedback. Thank you for all your hard work on the Drupal project.</p>
