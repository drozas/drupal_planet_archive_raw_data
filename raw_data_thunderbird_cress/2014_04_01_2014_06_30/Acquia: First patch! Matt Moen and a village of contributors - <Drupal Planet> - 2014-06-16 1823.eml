This time around, a patch written by <a href="http://drupal.org/u/fearlsgroove">Matt Moen</a>, Technical Director at <a href="http://www.kilpatrickdesign.com">Kilpatrick Design</a>, was selected for fast-track testing, approval, and was committed to Drupal 8 core in front of a few hundred of us at the Austin convention center. In this podcast, I talk with Matt about becoming a core contributor; we hear from <a href="http://drupal.org/u/webchick">Angie "webchick" Byron</a> about how it takes a village to commit a patch; and I've included a quick refresher on how version control works with the Gitty Pokey from the <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/welcome-to-drupalcon">DrupalCon Austin pre-keynote</a>. You can see the full patch approval and commit process in the 2nd video embedded on this page.</p>
