Using a few modules and HTML5 in-browser audio recording you can click a button and save your voice to your drupal site as s file field. This can bring new life to commenting on private forum where that might be valuable or in our context, allowing instructors to give audio feedback to students about their work in ways text alone can't describe.</p></div></div></div>
