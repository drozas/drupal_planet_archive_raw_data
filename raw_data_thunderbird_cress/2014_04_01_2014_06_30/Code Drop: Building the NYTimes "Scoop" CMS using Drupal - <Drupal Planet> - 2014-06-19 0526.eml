Looking at <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/scoop-a-glimpse-into-the-nytimes-cms/">the reveal article</a>, we were compelled with the functionality and level of polish the CMS appears to bring to the table. Naturally, this got us thinking what kind of work would be required to replicate some of the key features of the CMS in <a href="http://codedrop.com.au/drupal">Drupal</a> and what kind of trade-offs exist between leveraging existing Open Source solutions and building proprietary in house technology.</p>
