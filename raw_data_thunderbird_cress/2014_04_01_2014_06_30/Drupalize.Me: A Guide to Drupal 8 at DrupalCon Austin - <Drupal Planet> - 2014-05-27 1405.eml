	<a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Austin</a> is rapidly approaching and the big question on my mind is: <strong>What Drupal 8 sessions do I need to put on my radar?</strong> To figure that out, I've mined the schedule for Drupal 8 related talks and events and organized them a bit to help me – and hopefully you – find the Drupal 8 sessions not to be missed.
</p>
<h3>Information Overload</h3>
<p>The bottom line? There is a LOT of Drupal 8 content at DrupalCon Austin, as one would expect. So, what is my strategy for gleaning as much Drupal 8 information as possible for use in my work as a trainer? There are two facts that generally guide my strategy at DrupalCon:</p>
<ol><li>Sessions are recorded and archived on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrupalAssociation">Drupal Association's YouTube channel</a>.</li>
<li>BoFs are usually not recorded.</li>
</ol><p>So how does this help me decide what to do with my time? I check the BoF whiteboard early and often and if there's a BoF and a session at the same time that are equally interesting to me, I chose the BoF and make a note to watch the session recording later.</p></div></div></div>
