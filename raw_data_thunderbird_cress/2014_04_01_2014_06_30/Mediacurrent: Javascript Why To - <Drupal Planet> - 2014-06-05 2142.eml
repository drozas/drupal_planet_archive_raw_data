I want to make a case for why-to learn to write in JavaScript. Also note that if you’re in a place like I was just a few years ago with JS, you might not actually know JS yet.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">There are seemingly an ever-increasing number of efforts with the purpose of allowing programmers to write in some other language, like Java, CoffeeScript, C, etc., and then have a program turn that code into JavaScript for us.</span></p>
