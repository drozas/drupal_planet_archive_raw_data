Drupal supports content revisioning and there are already some contributed modules that exploit this extremely useful feature like revisioning. However when it comes to content deletion, revision system can no longer be used because when a content is deleted, it gets removed from database entirely including all its revisions.<br /><br /><a href="https://drupal.org/project/entity_soft_delete">Entity soft delete module</a> has been developed to address this limitation.</p><p><a href="http://sina.salek.ws/content/new-drupal-module-entity-soft-delete-entity-recyclebintrashbin" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
