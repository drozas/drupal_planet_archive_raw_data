            <p>It’s that time of year again: DrupalCon in the US! We’ll be headed to the great state of Texas – Austin, specifically – and we’re incredibly excited to get things rolling. Why? It’s the sharing of ideas, the culture, the community, and the fun – it’s like an enormous think-tank filled with like-minded, interesting individuals, from which new methods emerge and inspiration flows. Will you be there? Let us know <a href="http://palantir.net/contact">via email</a> or on <a href="http://twitter.com/palantir">Twitter</a>, or in the comments.</p>
<p>We’ve set up shop at <strong>booth 215</strong>, across from the Drupal Association and the Commerce Village (and right near one of the main coffee stations, thankfully). We hope you stop by and say hello, grab a button and sticker, play a little <em>Palantrivia</em> while you sip on a coffee, and hang out with the Palantiri that will inevitably be congregating at our booth throughout the week.</p>
<p>If we don’t catch you on the show floor for some odd reason, we do hope to see you during post-con hours – <strong>like at <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/trivia-night">Trivia Night</a></strong>, of which Palantir is a proud sponsor!</p>
<p>Of course, let’s not forget the point of DrupalCon: sharing and learning. To this end, we have 11 <a href="http://palantir.net/about">Palantiri</a> headed to the Con this year, some of whom are leading sessions. Here’s who’s going, and a rundown of sessions of interest: Sean Buscay, Kelsey Bentham, George DeMet, Larry “Crell” Garfield, Tom Jones, Steve Persch, Ken Rickard, Shawn Smith, Andrea Soper, Ryan Wagner, and Chris Zietlow.</p>
