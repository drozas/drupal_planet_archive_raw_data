<p>So much is happening this year. Drupal 8 is getting closer and closer to release, more and more Drupal businesses and services are being launched, and we continue to develop our Drupal products.</p>

<p>While my session on DevShop wasn't accepted, I am personally involved in a lot of BoF sessions this year.</p>

<h3><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/bof/drupalorg-github-living-harmony-hubdropio" target="_blank">Drupal.org &amp; GitHub, Living in Harmony: HubDrop.io</a></h3>

<p>On Tuesday, I'll be discussing the future of Drupal.org and GitHub integration via HubDrop.io, our git-mirror-as-a-service.  If you are interested in moving your module development to GitHub, but want to keep the code going to drupal.org to keep integrated with it's release system, than HubDrop is for you.  </p>

<p>We will chat about what HubDrop is, what it will be in the future, and we'll fan the long-running flamewar over whether drupal code hosting should just move to GitHub.</p>

<p><em>Room 10A (Ashday), 3rd floor.  Tuesday - 5:00 to 6:00</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/bof/great-multisite-debate" target="_blank">The Great Multisite Debate</a></h3>

<p>This BoF session was spawned by what I thought was a simple question posted on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<p>Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/getpantheon">@getpantheon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/acquia_support">@acquia_support</a>: True or False? You're <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23drupal&amp;src=hash">#drupal</a> multisite-ish offerings support site specific modules/themes/etc.</p>
— Jon Pugh (@jonpugh) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonpugh/statuses/467356419050577922">May 16, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>After a flurry of replies, Jakub Suchy from Acquia suggested to continue the conversation as a DrupalCon BoF.</p>

<p>Apparently I touched on a controversial subject!  </p>

<p>Multisite is a powerful (some would say dangerously so) feature of Drupal that let's you host many sites pointed at a single codebase on a server, and the Drupal hosting as a service companies out there are starting to offer multisite and multisite-like services.  </p>

<p>Aegir is built on the concept of multisite, but it's not a requirement to use it.  </p>

<p>During a temporary lapse in judgement, I offered to moderate this throwdown, so wish me luck.</p>

<p>Expect to see representatives from the Aegir project, Pantheon, Acquia, and more.  It's bound to be a spirited debate!</p>

<p><em>Room 8A - JustDigital | 3rd floor.  Thursday · 10:45-11:45</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/bof/aegir-hosting-system" target="_blank">Aegir Hosting Project</a></h3>

<p>Now that I've been invited to become a maintainer of the Aegir project, Christopher Gervais (the aegir lead) has invited me to join him at the Birds of a Feather session.</p>

<p>Come see what's new in Aegir 3, chat with other aegir users, and talk about what might be in store for the future.</p>

<p><em>Room 8B - Unicon | 3rd floor. Thursday · 02:15-03:15</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/bof/future-devshop-aegir-open-cloud-software" target="_blank">Future of DevShop, Aegir, &amp; Open Cloud Software</a></h3>

<p>As an alternative to my session on DevShop, I've scheduled a BoF on the future of DevShop.  I'd like to have a conversation about what people are interested and where things could go from here.  </p>

<p>As the year progresses I plan on releasing more tools for Aegir &amp; DevShop for cloud management. </p>

<p>If you haven't heard of DevShop yet, go read my session proposal: DevShop: Drupal DevOps in a Box<br />

<h3>Bats of a Feather</h3>

<p>So the BoFs are certainly where it is at this year.  I hope to see you there.  Please don't be afraid to get in touch if you'd like to meetup beyond the BoFs!</p>
