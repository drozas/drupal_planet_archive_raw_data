<ul><li>What is the theme of the track?</li>
</ul><p>I tried to make the theme consistent with the overall DrupalCon Prague theme of “One to many”.<br />
Leveraging new paradigms in Drupal 8: improving your projects and workflows<br />
Drupal as an application platform<br />
Integrating Drupal’s API with other systems and libraries</p>
<p>So we really want to present Drupal as a unifying platform, that can consolidate many technologies.</p>
<p>Part of that is what Alex is going to talk about in his featured session - removing some of the Drupalisms that we have all gotten used to in favour of incorporating best-of-breed open source components from outside the community. I think Symfony’s components are the most obvious example there, but there are a lot of other components too (like Guzzle, Doctrine).</p>
<p>Another element is the general move to OO, PSR-0, and the adoption of modern design patterns which bring us up to date with other major PHP projects. The plumbing is there now to integrate with other frameworks - and we’re doing that.</p>
<p>I’ve kind of been talking about low level code integrations, But theres also a lot that can and has been achieved with Drupal as it is today, by incorporating integrations with outside systems via web services, or supplying services to other systems. So I would like some of our presentations to cover how Drupal integrates, and maybe in ways you hopefully haven’t thought of.</p>
<h2>Session</h2>
<ul><li>What is the name of your session, and what is it going to be about?</li>
