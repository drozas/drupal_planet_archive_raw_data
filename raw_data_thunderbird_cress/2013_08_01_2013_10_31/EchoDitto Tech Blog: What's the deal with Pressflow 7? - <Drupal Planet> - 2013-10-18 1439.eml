It forked Drupal and added several performance enhancements, including the ability to use external caches. Since <a href="https://pressflow.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PF/Comparison+-+Pressflow+versus+Drupal">Drupal 7 incorporated lots of the Pressflow 6 features</a>, what's the deal with Pressflow 7?</p>

<p>After Drupal 7 launched, <a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/2010/jan/07/pressflow-7-continuing-push-performance-and-scalability-drupal/">it seemed like Pressflow 7 would continue the momentum from Pressflow 6 and greatly enhance Drupal 7</a>. But, here we are in 2013, and you don't hear about Pressflow 7 very often, and searching for differences does not yield much more than some diffs between baseline Drupal core 7 and <a href="https://github.com/pressflow/7">the Pressflow 7 repository on GitHub</a>. Since there are clearly some differences, let's dive in and see what they are exactly.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pressflow Smart Start</em> will forward you to the install page if the database is set up in settings.php but the database is empty, disabled by default.

</ul></li>
<li>APC CSS and JS check; to prevent Drupal from constantly checking the file system for core-aggregated CSS and JS files, use APC as a key:value store instead. This is very helpful improving performance for networked file systems by reducing the frequency Drupal hits the file system.

<li>Allow modules to act on the js_cache before writing to disk, and add a note to the aggregated JavaScript that it was built with PressFlow. This won't yield an immediate impact on anything, but adds additional functionality to modules.

<li>Allow sub-second delays for lock_wait(). The calculation Drupal currently does will allow a value of 0 for the lock wait time, effectively skipping it. When PHP converts to an integer, a float will always round down. For example, as Drupal performs the operation: <strong><code>php -r "echo (int) 0.25 * 20;"</code></strong> would return <strong><code>0</code></strong>. The Pressflow change corrects the order of operations and returns the correct value, for example: <strong><code>php -r "echo (int) (0.25 * 20);"</code></strong> would return <strong><code>5</code></strong>, allowing for sub-second delays to be used as an input to the function.
