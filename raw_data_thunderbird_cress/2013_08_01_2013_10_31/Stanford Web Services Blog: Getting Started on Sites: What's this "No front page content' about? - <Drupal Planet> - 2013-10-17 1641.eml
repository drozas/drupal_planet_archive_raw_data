You've tried everything from moving blocks to crossing your fingers and clenching your teeth and that phrase still pops up. How do you get rid of this?</p>
<p>What Drupal is telling you here is that your site needs a <strong>node (a "page")</strong> to be assigned as the front page. This is easily fixed.</p></div></div></div>
