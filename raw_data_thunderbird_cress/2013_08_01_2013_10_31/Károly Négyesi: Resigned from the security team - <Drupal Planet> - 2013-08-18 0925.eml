    <p>There is a module (which I will not link) which is a duplicate of another, providing functionality that is absolutely crucial to every high performance Drupal site. Now, aside from the dubious claims it being faster than the original (it has been proven not to be and so now there are only indirect claims of it on the project page), it have proposed to replace the original instead of cooperating and, worst of all, it made a syntax error in a stable release. Stable releases are under the security team umbrella.  For me, this situation is not acceptable. When I filed an issue in protest (which, to be fair, did not mention the security angle), the security team leader have said "I think it's fine to ignore this issue". I have no avenue left to protest but to resign from the security team. Once again, it's not really the specific module that is the problem it's just a symptom. We need to tear down the walls on who can create projects as it is clearly visible that they do not help at all and at the same time we need to change the role of the team and make it very clear that most modules are not under the security team umbrella. Discussions have happened about this for years now but I feel the time has run out. I am glad I could help this last eight years.</p>
