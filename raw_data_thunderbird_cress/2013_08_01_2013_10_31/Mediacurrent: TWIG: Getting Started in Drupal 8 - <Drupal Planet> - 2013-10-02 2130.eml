<p>In this presentation, Dante walks through the state of layout in D8, and what you should know to get started using TWIG. In the latest 2.x branch releases of Drupal the layout module has been taken out of core and now lives as its own separate contrib module. The current Layout module is still on version 1.x and will need to be updated to work with the latest build of D8. TWIG is a flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP. One of the major issues with D7 was that its theming layer was inconsistently implemented, and was open to non-secure coding practices. In this presentation Dante will review the steps you should take to get started using TWIG and point out helpful debugging techniques.&nbsp;</p>
