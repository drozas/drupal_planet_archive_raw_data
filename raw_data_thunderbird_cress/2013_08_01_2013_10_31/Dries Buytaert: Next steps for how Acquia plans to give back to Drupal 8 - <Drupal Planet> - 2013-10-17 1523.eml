In order to provide some more transparency, I wanted to share how we plan to give back between today and the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Drupal 8 beta 1</h2>
<p>Now that we're <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1052692#comment-7905115">forgoing an upgrade path for a migration path</a>, we need to redefine the release criteria for 'beta 1'.  We also need to track the issues that block beta in order to help escalate the most critical of the critical issues. We will work with the Drupal 8 core maintainers to define and communicate these criteria, and help with timely patch reviews and issue management for beta-blocking issues.</p>
<h2>Migrate module in core</h2>
<p>As a co-author of the Migrate module, Moshe will be assisting the core development team on the goal to get Migrate module functionality into core and support a Drupal 6 to Drupal 8, as well as the Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration path.</p>
<h2>Improve the Drupal 8 developer experience</h2>
<p>We want developers to be productive and enjoy writing Drupal 8 modules, so we will be fleshing out the <a href="https://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core/d8dx">D8DX battleplan</a> based on discussions at DrupalCon Prague, and working with others in the Drupal community to ensure that we fix the most important developer experience problems in preparation of Drupal 8's release.</p>
<h2>Develop learning resources</h2>
<p>We will be working on a central resource on Drupal.org for developers to find the information they need in order to port their modules to Drupal 8, including documentation, tools, and other resources.</p>
<h2>Evaluate semantic versioning</h2>
<p>There was a lot of talk at DrupalCon Prague about lessons learned in Drupal 7 and 8 and how to do better in the future. One such area of improvement is a release strategy that allows for iterative innovation in Drupal core every few months. We plan to work with other community leaders and the Drupal security team in order to come up with a strategy around this. A component of this strategy may be to <a href="https://drupal.org/node/586146">adopt semantic versioning</a>.</p>
<h2>Improve Drupal 8 performance</h2>
<p>We will also dedicate the OCTO team's time to help the Drupal core community identify and fix some major performance issues in Drupal core.</p>
<h2>Authoring experience improvements</h2>
<p>Major development efforts on the UX features the Spark team helped get into Drupal 8 core—WYSIWYG, in-place editing, mobile-friendly toolbar —are winding down. We still have work to do on fixing up some loose ends, and are committed to see this through.  We will also backport the major Spark modules to Drupal 7.</p>
<h2>Communicate Drupal 8 progress</h2>
<p>We aim to continue the weekly D8 progress reports that you can find at <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/98113">This Week In Core</a>, and are actively seeking other core developers to help get these important posts out.</p>
<h2>A drop in an ocean</h2>
<p>We're a handful of contributors in the OCTO and can only do so much. We will continue doing these things within a community of hundreds of other contributors and supporting their work in other ways. We're looking forward to much Drupal 8 progress in the next 3 months!</p>
