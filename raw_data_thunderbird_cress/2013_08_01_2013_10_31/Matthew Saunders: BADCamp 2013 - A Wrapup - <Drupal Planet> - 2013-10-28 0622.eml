It also had me eating some pretty great food including marinated baby squid.</p>
<p>I spent time in the Large Scale Drupal meeting.  There were lots of companies that many Drupal shops would not necessarily think about as being traditional Drupal users.  In fact, one of the more interesting deployments was with the Princess Cruise Ship line.  They are using Drupal internally on the ships to provide information to passengers.  They are running their own servers on the ship to avoid using external Internet because of the unique issues that come with moving around the world in places that don't always have access to communications that would provide Internet.</p>
<p>I also attended the Higher Education Summit.  <a href="http://www.atendesigngroup.com">Aten Design Group</a> was a sponsor.  I gave a lightning talk with 3 2 minute case studies covering three sites that Aten has created.  I talked about Poynter's News University, Stanford + Connects, and Aspirations.  They are all complex sites whose goals are to extend the educational experience of learners ranging from those planning for college to those who are looking to learn beyond graduation.  It was great knowing that Aten had helped the camp have the money they needed to conduct the summit.</p>
