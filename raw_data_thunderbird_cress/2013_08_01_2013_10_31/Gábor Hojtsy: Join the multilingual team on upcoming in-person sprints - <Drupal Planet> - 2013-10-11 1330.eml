Did you ever want to have a better multilingual solution in Drupal? Well, Drupal 8 is a big chance. While not everything will be perfect, it will be worlds apart from Drupal 7 in all the good ways. To quote some feedback from DrupalCon Prague: <em>The work you have done for translations is a 'game changer' for the future of Drupal.</em> and <em>Can't wait to be able to use it on production!</em></p>
<p>The best way to get started is to help fix the remaining issues! You not only get to have your hands on the new features in Drupal 8 and learn the intricacies of them, but also get mentorship on how to build with them and also help Drupal 8 get out sooner and be a better solution. We also have a lot of fun! Full of win!</p>

<p>To join in-person sprints, we have some options for you in the upcoming two months:</p>
<ul><li>First up is <a href="http://2013.badcamp.net/sprints">BADCamp</a> where you can join the amazing YesCT, Schnitzel, Kristen Pol (also presenting <a href="http://2013.badcamp.net/sessions/multilingual-module-madness-which-i18n-modules-do-you-really-need">about Drupal 7</a> and <a href="http://2013.badcamp.net/sessions/drupal-8-multilingual-awesomeness">Drupal 8 multilingual solutions</a> in sessions) and several other great people sprinting on making Drupal 8 multilingual. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtDYnjV5l0uydGpYdUlQNDFLZFRZajJFS3FQdm8wQVE#gid=0">The sprint goes all the way from the 21st of October to the 29th</a>.</li>
<li>There are also camps on the 26th/27th weekend in <a href="http://2013.drupalcamp.es/">Caceres, Spain</a> and <a href="http://drupalcamp-essen.de/13/">Essen, Germany</a>. Note that these are non-English speaking events. There are multilingual team luminaries at each event, so look for people like penyaskito (<a href="http://2013.drupalcamp.es/herramientas-para-sitios-multilenguaje-en-drupal-8">presenting Drupal 8 multilingual goodness in Caceres</a>), attrib (<a href="http://drupalcamp-essen.de/13/session/multilingual-site-tools-drupal-8">presenting the same in Essen</a>), webflo, and others. Sprint space / time commitments at these events are not guaranteed.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.hu/konferencia/2013">DrupalCamp Budapest</a> is on the 16th and 17th of November in Hungary, with the second day purely reserved for sprints. This is a great opportunity for hungarian speakers to engage in some core work. Early arrival and leaving late on the sprint day helps to make a dent! I'll be there.</li>
<li>I'll also be in full force at and after <a href="http://2013.drupalcamp.at/sprints">DrupalCamp Vienna in Austria</a>. This is an English speaking international event. Given Vienna is an entities/fields stronghold, we'll get to work with fago, fubhy, yched, etc. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aqi9fjij06SpdGdibzZPeE5LX1JlTE9qUEd5R0RKSXc#gid=0">The sprints run between the 24th and 26th of November</a>. So far I'm the only one specifically signed up for the multilingual sprint there, so don't let me be lonely!</li>
</ul><p>If you cannot make it to the in-person sprints, we are congregating in the <a href="https://drupal.org/irc">#drupal-i18n IRC channel</a> and have a meeting there every other Wednesday. See meeting dates/times on the front page of <a href="http://www.drupal8multilingual.org/">http://www.drupal8multilingual.org/</a>.</p>
