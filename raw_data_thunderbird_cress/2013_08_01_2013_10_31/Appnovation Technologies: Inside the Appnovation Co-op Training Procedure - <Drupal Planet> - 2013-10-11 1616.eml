    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>On the first day, Appnovation assigns each new developer a mentor. The mentor is dedicated to resolve any questions the new co-op student has regarding intermediate and advanced Drupal development. For training, the new co-op students are required to develop a new annotate module on Drupal.</p><p>To complete the annotate module, beginner knowledge of Drupal fundamentals are necessary. The module requires the student to understand and utilize the contributed modules from the Drupal community, such as the Features and Views modules. Also, the assignment tests the studentsâ€™ knowledge on PHP. If you are new to PHP, in order to quickly and sufficiently grasp PHP, go through w3schools PHP online examples.</p><p>If modules are the backbone of the Drupal development, then Drupal hooks are the bone cells used to create them. Two basic hook fundamentals to development are the menu hook and theme hook. They are almost always used when developing a new Drupal website.</p><p>At the core, Appnovation distributes websites; therefore, developers need to comprehend HTML, JavaScript, CSS and PHP syntax. To quickly summarize, the HTML is used to display content, JavaScript is used to trigger actions on the webpage, CSS used to theme the website and PHP is used to develop on the Drupal platform. Git is used as the version control system to collaborate on projects.</p><p>After grasping PHP, HTML and CSS, a great book to read is <em>Drupal 7 Module Development</em> written by Butcher, Dunlap, Farina, Garfield, Rickard and Wilkens. This book provides the theory and the examples necessary to enhance Drupal development skills.</p><p>Appnovation cares about their employees. Even though the majority of the training is self-taught, the assigned mentor is a great resource. In addition, the current staff is inclined to answer any questions and solve problems together.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-blog-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Blog Tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/content-tags/drupal-0" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">drupal</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/content-tags/appnovation" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">appnovation</a></div><div class="field-item even"><a href="/content-tags/co-op" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">co-op</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-section field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Section:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/section/drupal" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">Drupal</a></div></div></div>
