<p>We are happy to announce that the 2014 edition of Drupal Developer Days will take place in Szeged, Hungary in March 2014. Prior events in the series in Dublin, Barcelona, Brussels and Munich were in the summer, however with Drupal 8 in heavy development and DrupalCon Austin in June, March 2014 is the right time for this get-together!</p>
<h3 class="content">What is Drupal Developer Days?</h3>
<p>Drupal Developer Days is a community organised developer focused conference for Drupal coders and builders that includes extensive sprints to work on Drupal core and contributed projects. It complements <a href="http://frontendunited.org">Frontend United</a> (for designers and themers) and <a href="http://www.drupalbusinessdays.org/">Drupal Business Days</a>.</p>
<h3 class="content">When?</h3>

<p>Drupal Developer Days will feature code sprints that run from Monday, March 24, to Sunday, March 30, 2014. </p>
<p>On Thursday, Friday and Saturday March 27-29 there will be three days of workshops and presentations focused on Drupal and web development topics with a focus on Drupal 8. </p>
<p>This is the event to go in Europe to work on and learn about Drupal 8 early in depth! Depending on the release status of Drupal 8 at the time, we’ll either work heavily on core or port contributed modules, but nonetheless we’ll share our Drupal 8 experiences.</p>
<p>Brace yourself for a lot of other types of fun as well!</p>

<p>Where on Earth is Szeged? Does it even have an airport? (No.) Why go this far for a Drupal event? The exact same questions have been asked by people when they were thinking about coming to <a href="http://szeged2008.drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon Szeged in 2008</a>. Here are some quotes from after that event:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>”The team who ran this Drupalcon just rocked the socks off!”</em> - @add1sun, Lullabot</li>
<li><em>”Had one hell of a blast at the drupalcon in Szeged”</em> - @mortendk, Geek Royale</li>
<li><em>”Most Geek-Rawkin-Awesome DrupalCon! Szeged rulez OK! Thanks to all who made it so great!”</em> - @horncologne, Acquia</li>
<li><em>”This conference brought the community feel like 24/7 vs. just being in the venue.”</em> - @add1sun, Lullabot</li>
<li><em>”I expected to enjoy the trip, but it far exceeded my expectations, and Drupalcon itself was very well executed and managed.”</em> - @EclipseGc, Commerce Guys</li>
<li><em>”#drupalcon is *very* inspiring, really starting to feel like family, although some uncles and nephews are a bit...strange ;-)”</em> - @niels_bom, Minddistrict.nl</li>
<li><em>”Well done, the con was EXCELLENT. [...] Had a total blast, especially the evenings, Szeged was great.”</em> - @NickLP, Kineta Systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Enough reasons to come to Szeged (again)? If you have been there before, you know you want to! If you have not, now is the time to do it! We are also making sure this event will be affordable for a wide range of attendees.</p>
