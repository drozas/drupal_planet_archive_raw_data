    <p>We&#39;ve all had clients we love to hate. You know, the client that eats into your bank account, your sleep, and drives you nuts via the modern torture device of email. <strong>They are NEVER happy, don&#39;t seem to know what they want, never give you the right content, and can&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t just make a $1.5mil project for $25,000.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to vent and blame it all on the client, but how do you know that the failed relationship is all on the client? <strong>In my experience there are two main reasons that client relationships don&#39;t work out, and both are preventable as a web consultant if you pay attention and prepare ahead of time.</strong></p>
