    When a user is trying to search something on your website, you want to help them find what they want quickly. We are human, we make mistakes. When users make a typo, we should try to guess what they are looking for so that they don't have to type it again. Especially when more users use their smart phone/tablet to browse the web. It is much harder for them to re-type their searches.
