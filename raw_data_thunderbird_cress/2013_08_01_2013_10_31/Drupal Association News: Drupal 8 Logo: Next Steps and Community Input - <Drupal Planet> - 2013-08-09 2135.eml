More than 20 designers or firms have expressed interest and weâ€™re still going through portfolios and conducting interviews. That part of the process should be complete by early next week. As mentioned in the design brief, the Drupal 8 branding will be an important element of the marketing of Drupal 8 and the goal is to have it complete in time for DrupalCon Prague.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-4 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Personal blog tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/taxonomy/term/743">Drupal 8</a></div></div></div>
