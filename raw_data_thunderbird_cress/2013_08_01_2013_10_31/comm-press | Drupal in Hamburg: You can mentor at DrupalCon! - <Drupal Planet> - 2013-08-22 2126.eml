    <h2>Mentors Wanted</h2>
By Cathy Theys
<p>32 days to go until <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Prague</a>. And... we need 25 more mentors. Can you mentor? Maybe. If you have experience working in the issue queue, understand how d.o works, and can support people as you find answers to their questions together, then you can mentor. Even our experienced mentors do not know all the answers, but we know how to start looking for the answers. <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/help-mentor-new-contributors">Sign up to mentor!</a></p>

<p>If you are not mentoring, be sure to <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/news/help-make-difference-contribution-sprints-are-friday-27.-september">stay for the Friday Sprint</a> either to participate with a mentor, or sprint in the general sprint. And... remember the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/310893">extended sprints</a> when you are planning your travel.</p>
