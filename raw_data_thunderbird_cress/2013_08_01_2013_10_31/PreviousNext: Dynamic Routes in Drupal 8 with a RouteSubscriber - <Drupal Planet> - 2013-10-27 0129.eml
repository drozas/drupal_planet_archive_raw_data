But that's not where the fun ends!</p>
<p>What about when we need to create a route <em>dynamically</em>. For example, if we need to create routes for content types that we don't know will exist in advance?  In Drupal 7, we created dynamic routes with a foreach loop in hook_menu(). In Drupal 8, we can do all this and more with a RouteSubscriber.</p>
