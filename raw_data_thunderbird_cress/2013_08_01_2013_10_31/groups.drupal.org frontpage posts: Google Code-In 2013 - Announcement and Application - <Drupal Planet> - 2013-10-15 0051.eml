    <p><strong>Are you interested in contributing to Drupal, but don't have the coding skills or experience necessary?</strong> Good news, now you have an awesome opportunity to contribute!  Drupal is currently in the application process to be a part of the Google Code-In ( <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2013" title="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2013">http://www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2013</a> ) contest for pre-university students ages 13-17. Our current need is building a list of quality tasks for students to work on during the contest. Please realize these don't have to be code related tasks, but should fit into one of the following five categories: Code, Documentation/Training, Outreach/Research, Quality Assurance, User Interface.</p>
<p>The application process <strong>started Wednesday October 9th and ends this Friday October 18th. Our goal is to submit an application with at least 25 quality tasks. Please contribue by adding task ideas directly in the wiki ( <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/348338" title="https://groups.drupal.org/node/348338">https://groups.drupal.org/node/348338</a> ) until midnight UTC-6 Thursday October 17th</strong>.  After that, we need to see if Drupal is approved for the contest.  If approved, we will need help creating, documenting, and mentoring an additional 100-200 tasks. The more tasks we setup the more opportunities we have to contribue to Drupal.</p>
<p>Did you know that organizations accepted into the GCI contest send the top two students on an all expense paid 5 day trip to Google in Mountain View with a parent/guardian ( <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2013/help_page#prizes" title="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2013/help_page#prizes">http://www.google-melange.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci20...</a> )? I know that I would be very excited as a young computer nerd to even have a chance to participate in such a program.  As a community, we have a very good chance to make connections with young students who could end up spending a good amount of time focusing on Drupal after completing the contest. <strong>A good way to find quality contributors might be Drupal sending a few young people to California/GoogleHQ</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>GCI Summary:</strong><br />
"Code-In can be thought of as the "Summer of Code" for pre-university students. Rather than specific coding projects, students age 13-17 take on smaller tasks in five categories: Code, Documentation/Training, Outreach/Research, Quality Assurance, User Interface."</p>
