            <p>Later this week, dozens of people from around the world will gather in Chicago to spend three days helping to get the next version of Drupal ready for release. If you’re looking for an opportunity to get involved with Drupal development at any level, the <a href="http://mwds.eventbrite.com/">Midwest Drupal Summit</a> is an event you won’t want to miss.</p>
<p>The Summit is a set of sprints being led by some of the biggest names in Drupal, including project lead <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1">Dries Buytaert</a> and Drupal 8 co-maintainer <a href="http://drupal.org/user/157725">Alex Pott</a>, as well as Drupal 8 initiative leaders and key Drupal contributors including Larry Garfield (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/26398">Crell</a>), John Albin Wilkins (<a href="https://drupal.org/user/32095">JohnAlbin</a>), Jen Lampton (<a href="https://drupal.org/user/85586">jenlampton</a>), Dave Reid (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/53892">Dave Reid</a>), Cathy Theys (<a href="https://drupal.org/user/258568">YesCT</a>), <a href="http://drupal.org/user/65776">xjm</a>, and yours truly (<a href="https://drupal.org/user/118398">gdemet</a>).  </p>
<p>Even if you aren’t an experienced Drupal developer, the Midwest Drupal Summit has something for you. We’ll have a new contributor sprint designed to give you hands-on training and mentoring, and several other sprints, including D8 Launch Content for Drupal.org and Twig/Theming, are looking for help from non-technical contributors. This is an unprecedented opportunity to level up your involvement with the Drupal community.</p>
<p>The Midwest Drupal Summit is being held this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, August 15-17 at Palantir’s offices on the north side of Chicago. You do not have to attend all three days; however, folks who attend on Saturday may enjoy the added bonus of flyovers from the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_air_and_watershow.html">Chicago Air and Water Show</a> on our rooftop deck.</p>
<p>Registration is $30 per person and includes meals and refreshments all three days, which are made possible by sponsors including Acquia, Duo Consulting, 601am, Promet Source, Mediacurrent, and Palantir.  We’re planning to not just get a lot done, but also have a good time doing it!</p>
<p>Register now at <a href="http://mwds.eventbrite.com/">http://mwds.eventbrite.com/</a>, but don’t delay: ticket sales close at end of day on August 12 and there will be no on-site registration during the summit.  We hope to see you there!</p>
