<h2 id="mediacoreconversation">Media core conversation</h2>
<ul><li>Presented by <a href="http://janezurevc.name/">Janez Urevc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/let%E2%80%99s-fix-file-and-media-handling-once-and-all">Video and slides</a></li>
</ul><p>Although the code and architecture apparently leaves much to be desired, the <a href="http://janezurevc.name/why-do-we-complain-about-drupal-media-solutions-aka-lffamhoafa-pt-2">top user-facing feature requests</a> have all been added to Drupal 8. Multi file uploads, WYSIWYG integration, re-use of media through a site-wide media library are all in place.</p>
<p>The conclusion was that there is no clear overall picture of all the moving parts on the API level. A brainstorm session was held on sprint Friday. <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/327768">Have a look at the proposed architecture</a>. </p>
<p>As a user experience designer, it was great to see that Janez had conducted user research <em>and</em> that the sprint focussed on getting a shared understanding first, possible solutions second.</p>
<h2 id="experiencedrivenopensource">Keynote: Experience Driven Open Source</h2>
<ul><li>By <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/">Aral Balkan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/keynote/aral-balkan">Video</a></li>
</ul><p>Aral made a compelling case for the importance great user experience in open source projects. All those awesome free web services are free because you provide your data. Owning your data <em>is</em> an important topic. So yes, there’s definately room for what Aral calls “Experience-driven Open”. <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/notes/codename-prometheus/">Read more about his Codename Prometheus project here</a>.</p>
<p>My take-away for Drupal here was yet more confirmation that we really do need a more usable and useful initial setup for Drupal 8…</p>
<h2 id="vivasnowman">Viva Snowman!</h2>
<ul><li>Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/eaton">Jeff Eaton</a> and yours truly</li>
<li><a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/install-profiles-core-we-can-do-it">Video</a></li>
</ul><p>The idea for a core install profile that serves a more specific use case has been around for a couple of years. It’s only now with Drupal 8 that we actually have enough tools and features in core that such a specific configuration is now possible.</p>
<p>It was fun to see the room agreeing that this is a good idea yet immediately go looking for ways how to keep it outside core :-)</p>
<p>Has to be in the box to be available out of box though! <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/snowman">Keep an eye on the Snowman discussion group</a>.</p>
<h2 id="future-friendlyevolutionandthedrupalreleasecycle">Future-friendly evolution and the Drupal release cycle</h2>
<ul><li>Presented by <a href="http://garfieldtech.com/">Larry Garfield</a></li>
<li><a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/future-friendly-evolution-and-drupal-release-cycle">Video</a></li>
</ul><p>Larry took a packed room of core developers through how we have been working now, roughly summarized as a three year cycle of slash-and-burn-out without really evolving the APIs of the current release.</p>
<p>But what if we did allow/force ourselves to improve and evolve Drupal 8 instead of directly diving into Drupal 9 to reinvent and improve all the things?</p>
<p>Take 6 months for each 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 release and allow new features and API improvements. Open up Drupal 9 development not before 1 year of Drupal 8 being released.</p>
<p>We’ll see more discussion around this topic for sure. Larry provided us with a great framework for how we can live up to the level of maturity the Drupal project has achieved by now.</p>
<h2 id="announcingdrupalconamsterdam">Announcing Drupalcon Amsterdam</h2>
<p>A personal highlight was announcing Drupalcon Amsterdam for 2014 with <a href="https://twitter.com/barisw">Baris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bertboerland">Bert</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/accessadvertising/9952168534/">Our orange suits</a> performed well it seems :-) Looking forward to yet another greatest Drupalcon ever in Amsterdam.</p>
<h2 id="meetingallofyou">Meeting all of you</h2>
<p>Drupal.org content working group meetings, beers in the lobby, sponsoring ycheds new laptop, late night walks through Prague or coding in the coder lounge…</p>
<p>The best thing of course is meeting all of you. So great to talk, drink and dine with the real humans behind all those nicknames in IRC.</p>
<p>So many very special people with a heart, it’s inspriring and energizing. Thanks all.</p>
