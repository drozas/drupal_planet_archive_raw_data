<p>I’m happy to announce the release of a supported Command Line Interface (CLI) for the Pantheon platform. It’s free, open-source, built on Drush, and available on GitHub:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus">https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus</a></p>

<p>In a nutshell, Terminus allows you to do anything you can in the Pantheon dashboard from a terminal:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create new sites, including sites using Drupal Installation Profiles</li>
<li>Trigger workflow operations, including deploying and syncing</li>
<li>Connect to services (e.g. mysql or redis) over secure SSH tunnels</li>
</ul>

<p>Full command documentation is available <a href="http://helpdesk.getpantheon.com/customer/portal/articles/1315417">in the helpdesk</a>.</p>

<p>Since Terminus is a command-tool that means it’s scriptable, opening the door for all kinds of DevOps workflows, including deeper integration with other projects aimed to ease the lives of developers, such as the <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/proviso-vagrant-based-development-standardized">Proviso</a> initiative, or plug-and-play environments like <a href="http://www.kalamuna.com/products/kalabox">Kalabox</a>.</p>

<p>You can get started with Terminus quite easily, and it only takes a minute to see the value:</p>

<p><strong>CLI 4 Life</strong></p>

<p>One of our goals in building Pantheon was to free web developers from the role of “accidental sysadmin”. By eliminating the need to even think about servers, we’ve eliminated a major source of organizational friction and saved countless thousands of person-hours doing digital janitorial (and sometimes firefighting) work.</p>

<p>With that said, the command line is a critical tool in many developers’ toolbelts. You can take mine when you pry it from my cold dead hands. While web interfaces are good, and can help put the power of Pantheon in the hands of a wide audience, truly brilliant developer workflows all start on the command line.</p>

<p>I believe that as we mature and expand this toolset, we’ll not only be saving time and frustration with people who are tired of “clicking around” to get things done, we’ll be opening the door to innovation from the wider developer community outside the Pantheon office. I can’t wait to see what people build on top of Terminus.</p>

<p><strong>Doing it Right</strong></p>

<p>Part of why I’m so excited is that it’s already happening. When we thought about how we wanted to build this interface, Free and Open was the only way. It wouldn’t make a lick of sense to try and keep the operation of this toolkit locked up or proprietary, so we’ve released it under the MIT license.</p>

<p>As a result, we’ve already had valuable contributions from avid Pantheon developers in our initial Beta period. In particular I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/mikemilano">Mike Milano</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benbunk">Ben Bunk</a> for their pull requests, and <a href="https://github.com/patcon">Patrick Connolly</a>, the <a href="http://www.kalamuna.com/about">Kalabots</a>, and the other Proviso provocateurs for their ideas, input and encouragement.</p>

<p>It’s still early days for Terminus. This initial release is going to see frequent updates as we complete Dashboard API coverage, improve the import/migration workflow, implement large-scale operations, etc. Now is a great time to tell us about your dream workflows and practical use-cases for Pantheon, so we can start architecting for them.</p>

<p>The best way to contribute is through the GitHub project. We also have been discussing it on the Pantheon’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/getpantheon.com/forum/#!forum/engineering-talk">engineering-talk</a> mailing list, which is open to all our users. Stay tuned there for more updates, and don’t hesitate to reach out with your ideas or contributions. </p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-blog-categories field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Blog Categories:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/categories/engineering">engineering</a></div></div></div><div class="easy_social_box clearfix horizontal easy_social_lang_und">
