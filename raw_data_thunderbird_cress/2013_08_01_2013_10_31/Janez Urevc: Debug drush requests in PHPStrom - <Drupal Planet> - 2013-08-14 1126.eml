    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today I needed to debug <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a> request. Since I've been using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a> for last few weeks I wanted to use it for that. After a bit of research I found this way to achieve what I needed:</p>
<ol><li>Install and configure Xdebug. There are plenty <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=xdebug+installation">posts about this all over the internet</a>.</li>
<li>Start normal web debug session in PHPStorm. Look for <em>"Waiting for incoming connection with ide key '17862'."</em> in PHPStorm's debug window. 17862 will be something else in your case. Remember this number as we're going to need it in next steps.</li>
<li>Open terminal and set new variable<br /><pre>
export XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=17862"</pre><p>Remember to replace "17862" with the number you remembered in the previous step.</p></li>
<li>Run your drush command and PHPStorm should stop on first breakpoint that you've set.</li>
</ol><p>Tadaaaa! :) That was easy. I'm not sure if there is any even more convenient way to do this. If you're aware about it, please feel free to leave a comment.Â </p>
