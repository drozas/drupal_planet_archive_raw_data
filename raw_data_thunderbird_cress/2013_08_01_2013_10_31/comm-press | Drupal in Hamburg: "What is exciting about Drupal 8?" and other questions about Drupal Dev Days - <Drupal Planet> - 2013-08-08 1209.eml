    <h2>30 people answer 3 questions at Drupal Dev Days in Dublin</h2>
By John Heaven
<p>Lots of people are really excited about Drupal 8, for lots of different reasons. I asked thirty people at <a href="http://dublin2013.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Dev Days in Dublin</a> what they are excited about, and put together a video with them saying what that is. We got a very wide range of answers, from whole initiatives such as multilingual and configuration management, to individual features such as inline editing or form modes; and then some goodies for developers such as the use of Symfony, testable code, and the use of Twig.</p>

<p>You can see the answers in my video on the <a href="https://youtube.com/commpress">comm-press YouTube channel</a>, or in more detail in the captions to <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/105339698846668805916/albums/5895037456147452961">this photo album on Google+</a>. We got a good amount of resonance thanks to the community's interest and their help in sharing the video via their own Twitter accounts, as well as in IRC. At the time of writing, we've got over 800 views for the video.</p>

<h3>What progress was made at Drupal Dev Days in Dublin?"</h3>

<p>I also asked the same people where progress was made at Drupal Dev Days. We got a few people saying that the multilingual initiative was very present and well organised, which I'm sure GÃ¡bor will be pleased to hear, and some useful insights into things that until now were (at least for me) not that well known: again, form modes, which allow site-builders to configure the layout of editing forms in the same way as you can configure the presentation of nodes in Drupal 7, and the Seven Style Guide, which means that the backend theme will be consistently themed and look great. The installer, which is a lot of people's first interaction with Drupal, already looks fantastic! I'll be honest, we didn't get as much resonance for this video, perhaps because the question referred to the specific event rather than Drupal 8 itself. But who cares ... the mini video project was worth it even for me to get to know 30 other participants and learn what is moving forward in Drupal 8.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFuWOEeJY9I&feature=c4-overview&list=UUY_tQSDvuMGN58L4MtHdDxQ">the video on our YouTube channel</a>, or again, you can see more detailed answers in <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/105339698846668805916/albums/5895053011921885745">the photo album on our Google+ page</a>. (The pictures in each of the albums are exactly the same, just the captions are different.)</p>

<h3>What is high priority for Drupal 8?</h3>

<p>Finally, I asked 29 people what is high priority for Drupal 8 in the coming weeks and months. The video will be published in the coming days, but for a sneak preview of the answers, check out <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/105339698846668805916/albums/5895055277488063745">this Google+ album</a> with the answers in the captions. Without doing a proper count, the most often repeated answer was probably bug-fixing or increasing the stability of Drupal 8 so that it can be finished as soon as possible. My favourite answer: what will we be doing for a release party?</p>

<p>Anyone I missed in the video? Don't worry - I'll see you at <a href="http://drupal-camping.de/en">Drupal Camping</a> or in Prague!</p>
