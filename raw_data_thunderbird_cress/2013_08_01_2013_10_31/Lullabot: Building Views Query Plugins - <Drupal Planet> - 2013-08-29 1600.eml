    <p>While we were building <a href="http://lullabot.com">the new Lullabot site</a>, we decided that we wanted a slideshow of 'bots out and about doing their thing. Kicking ass and having fun at events is a big part of the Lullabot culture, and we wanted to show it off. We thought it would be fun to show a slideshow of the 20 or 30 most recent photos from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/lullabot-team/">the Lullabot team pictures Flickr group</a> on our Who We Are page, to give a taste of what its like to be a bot.</p>
