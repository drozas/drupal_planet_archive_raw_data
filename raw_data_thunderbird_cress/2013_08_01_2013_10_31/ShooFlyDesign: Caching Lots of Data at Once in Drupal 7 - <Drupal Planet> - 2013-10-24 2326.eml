    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>I'm working on a Drupal project that requires calculating some custom stats for each registered user.  To get it working, I ran my SQL queries right in <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21user%21user.api.php/function/hook_user_load/7">hook_user_load()</a>, which is wildly inefficient; it's much better to run the queries once and cache the results for a while.  Drupal has nice <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes%21cache.inc/7">cache functions</a> built-in, but I wasn't totally clear on how to use them based on the documentation.</p>

<p>Jeff Eaton of Lullabot wrote a <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/beginners-guide-caching-data-drupal-7">really helpful article on how to do basic caching in Drupal 7</a>, which is a good introduction, but didn't really explain how to cache a bunch of related, but separately calculated, pieces of data using a function you'd call repeatedly.  <a href="https://drupal.org/project/examples">Examples module</a> is also great, and does include a cache_example module, but also didn't have an example that was right up my alley.</p>

<p>So, here's how to write a single function that can cache data for a bunch of similar objects (in my case, users). Now, of course there are probably ways to make this better, but it does work!</p>
