    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Drupal 8 is coming up! Check out <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-8.0">https://drupal.org/drupal-8.0</a> for all the goodness that is coming! While on the surface, a freshly installed Drupal 8 does not look all that different than Drupal 7 (the backend looks and the menus are similar), the underlying system is way more powerful and flexible. We turned flexibility up a notch in countless areas.</p>
<p>How best to get to know this new version? Well, there are blog posts and videos plenty as we get closer to Drupal 8 being more stable. I am writing <a href="http://hojtsy.hu/multilingual-drupal8">an article series on multilingual improvements</a> myself. We do know that some people learn great on a focused day of training though, so some of us decided to offer community training (read: really cheap!) before DrupalCamp Vienna on several Drupal 8 topics.</p>
<p>Along <a href="https://2013.drupalcamp.at/trainings/tickets">many other great trainings</a>, on November 21st 2013, I'm doing <a href="https://2013.drupalcamp.at/training/drupal-8-multilingual-hands">an all day hands-on with Drupal 8's multilingual system</a> including site building and some coding as well.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward this training because I have seven years of experience commercially training people on HTML, Perl, PHP, XML, XSLT, Drupal, etc. and really love the work that is going into assembling materials and setting up a coherent system to teach capabilities and possibilities. I am also looking for this opportunity to find more Drupal 8 bugs (which I will both in preparation and we will as part of the training, I'm sure - Drupal 8 is not yet ready after all). This is a great opportunity to do some deep-dives into what changed in Drupal 8 and learn the new best practices.</p>
<p>I did presentations about Drupal 8 multilingual improvements at various camps and DrupalCons and the feedback was amazing. Someone wrote in Prague: <em>Good session, maybe it would need a little bit more time or limit the content. Presentator felt little overconfident, but that may be just me. He certainly knows what he is talking about.</em>. I cannot help the strong confidence, as I really think Drupal 8 is going to rock your socks off in terms of multilingual improvements. But this is the opportunity to have plenty time to explore all the changes and get to know in a way you would not have a chance for a long while at least.</p>
<p>Sign up for the training at <a href="https://2013.drupalcamp.at/trainings/tickets">https://2013.drupalcamp.at/trainings/tickets</a>, it is just 50 EUR. See you there!</p>
