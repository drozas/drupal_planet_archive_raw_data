<p>The idea behind distributions was born in 2004.</p>
<p>Howard Dean, then a candidate in the United States presidential primaries, used the Internet for a groundbreaking campaign. A volunteer project called DeanSpace, which operated with little involvement or support from the Dean campaign organization, used Open Source as a tool for building community among Dean supporters. Dean's success in achieving front-runner status in the campaign was credited to their use of Open Source, social media, and community.</p>
