    <p><img style="float: right;" src="http://www.ostraining.com/images/ostrainingcom/drupal-media.jpg" alt="Re-write Output from the Drupal Media Module" />One of the great things with Drupal is the ability to over-write just about anything!</p>
<p>We had a questionin our support forums this week that put that ability to the test a little.</p>
<p>Our member wanted to provide a way for her clients to upload a PDF into a node and allow her users to easily download them. However, instead of a PDF icon and the title of the PDF, she wanted the link to say "Download PDF".</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ostrainingdrupal/~4/-sInABO6StY" height="1" width="1"/>
