            <p>A few days ago, Drupal hosting and support giant Acquia published an article guest authored by Palantir’s Senior Architect and Consultant Larry Garfield. The post generated eyebrow-raising traffic and social shares, with more than 8,000 page views in the first 24 hours alone. Huh.</p>
<p>The headline? “<a href="https://www.acquia.com/blog/look-phps-continuing-evolution">A Look at PHP’s Continuing Evolution</a>.” Aside from issues of celebrity (we cite only half-jokingly), we wonder as to what to attribute the popularity of this post? We certainly can’t blame puffery. Information gaps? If they exist, how can Palantir help to further fill them?</p>
<p>Larry surmises his post might serve as a leveraging tool: "Newer versions of PHP have really advanced the language considerably, but there's always a lag before they're widespread. People like having more reasons to pressure their web hosts and sysadmins to upgrade. I hope my article helps that cause."</p>
<p>Sound explanation. What's your take?</p>
