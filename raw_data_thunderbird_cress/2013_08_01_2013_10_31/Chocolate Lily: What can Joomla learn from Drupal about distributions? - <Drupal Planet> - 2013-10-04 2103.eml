<blockquote><p>
  The Joomla! CMS [content management system] seeks to create a variety of distributions of the CMS to address a variety of common niche markets.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Good idea!</p>
<p>As a Drupal developer with a longtime focus on distributions ("distros"), I'd like to support this Joomla initiative. As a first step, as followup to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#%21topic/joomla-dev-general/Fg-OtJjtA0c">posting in the Joomla development forum</a>, I thought I'd try to write up some observations on Drupal, Joomla, and distros.</p>
<p>I've written this with an intended audience of Joomla developers. But if you're a Drupal contributor, please wade in as well! </p>
