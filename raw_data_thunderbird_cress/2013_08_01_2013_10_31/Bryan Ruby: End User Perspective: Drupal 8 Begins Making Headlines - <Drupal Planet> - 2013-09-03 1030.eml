    <p>While Drupal 8 has been been under development for&nbsp;<a href="http://buytaert.net/starting-to-work-on-drupal-8">two and a half years</a>, I haven't talked much about it. I learned long ago that it doesn't do much good to talk about an upcoming release of a CMS until the software crosses over from what most of us would consider "vaporware."</p>
<p>The software needs to be close to beta, allowing for&nbsp;<em>normal</em>&nbsp;folks to actually be able install for testing purposes with a reasonable amount of certainty we don't need to be a developer. If you're a loyal reader of&nbsp;<a href="https://drupal.org/planet">Planet Drupal</a>, by now you should be getting a sense that the time has come to finally talk about Drupal 8.</p>
<p>There are a great number of changes coming with Drupal 8. So many, that I'm bound not to understand them all at this point. However, if you take a look at the core initiatives you can see where the core developers are working their hardest in improving Drupal 8.</p>
<p>Some of the great things planned for Drupal 8 include better HTML5 and mobile support, improved multilingual features, and setting up Drupal 8 on a modern web development framework (Symfony). Additional focus includes configuration management improvements and support for Views in the Drupal 8 core. While there is still&nbsp;<a href="https://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core">work to be done</a>, the core developers are starting to see the finish line in their sight.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, there are some headlines within the Drupal community that tells me from the user point of view it's time to show some interest in the upcoming Drupal 8. Some of the recent blog posts within the Drupal community I see worthy of mentioning can be found <a href="http://cmsreport.com/articles/end-user-perspective-drupal-8-begins-making-headlines-5679#headlines">below</a>.</p>
