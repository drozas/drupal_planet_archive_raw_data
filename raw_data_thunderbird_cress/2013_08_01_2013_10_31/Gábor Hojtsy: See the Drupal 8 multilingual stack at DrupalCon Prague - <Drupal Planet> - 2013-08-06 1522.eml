<p>I'll talk about all the <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/multilingual-site-tools-drupal-8">multilingual site tools in Drupal 8</a> that were added and improved thanks to <a href="http://www.drupal8multilingual.org/team">over 800 (yes eight hundred) collaborators</a> who keep working tirelessly so we have a fundamentally multilingual system in Drupal 8.</p>
<p>While Drupal 8 makes almost anything multilingual, overarching workflows and full multilingual site management tools are not included. That is where the <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/translation-management">Translation Management Tools session</a> comes in. Come to Michael Schmid's and Christophe Galli's session to learn about the missing workflow and integration layer that is there for you in contrib.</p>
<p>See all the other accepted sessions for even more reasons to come at <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/sessions">https://prague2013.drupal.org/sessions</a>. Register for the conference at <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/register">https://prague2013.drupal.org/register</a> </p>
