    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>On October 13, Propeople attended Lviv Euro DrupalCamp 2013, and there are tons of impressions we’re willing to share.</p><p>This was the second edition of Lviv Euro DrupalCamp. It becomes a tradition for Propeople to attend this event and there are more than one reasons why we all love it so much.</p><p>First of all, we were charmed by Lviv itself. It’s one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, it’s also called “Little Paris of Ukraine”. The historic center is in UNESCO’s World Heritage list, no wonder why. It’s architecture is a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions of Eastern Europe, Italy and Germany. It’s actually telling you a story every time you visit Lviv. Lviv is full of hidden legends that you can hear from people who live there. Every place, every sign on the wall has it’s own legend. It’s just impossible to describe, you should be there and feel it yourself.</p><p>We arrived just a day before the camp so we could spent more time in the city. It was the first time for some of us in Lviv, and some of us were lucky enough to be there at the previous Lviv Euro DrupalCamp, back in 2012. We had a goal - to visit as many famous Lviv places as possible and we did it. Yay!</p><p>The next day, October 12, all attendees had the chance to participate in 2 major events. One of them was the Poker tournament. The grand-prix was a ticket to DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014. We were not ready to spend half a day playing poker, we just spent more time in Lviv’s downtown. Roman Paska got the champion’s cup and a certificate which will probably be exchanged for a real DrupalCon ticket later. Congratulations!</p><p>The second activity was an amazing pre-party. It’s already a tradition for LEDC to organize pre-parties at “Robert Doms Beer House”. This fantastic, utterly unique beer hall is located three stories underground in a centuries-old beer-storage vault once used by the neighbouring Lvivske brewery. “Lvivske” is probably the best beer you can find in Lviv and Ukraine. Having a party before the camp is a nice chance to make some new friends, connections, pitch your presentation, and just have a lot of fun. The hall was actually full of exciting Drupal guys, tons of beer, live music and exciting atmosphere. We were able to get home just in time to get a sleep and be ready for next morning sessions.</p><p>Propeople held 3 presentations this time:</p><ul><li>“Panels for Beginners” by Cebotari Chirill,</li><li>“Building Drupal distributions. Why? When? and How?” by Alexei Gorobets,</li><li>“Creating cTools plugins”, by Vadim Malai.</li></ul><h5> </h5><h5>Alexei Gorobets, Drupal Developer</h5><p>There were no tracks and no categorization by level of knowledge, so the only instrument you could use to pitch your session was your session title, but that was not an issue for savvy attendees, as they made sure to fill any gaps with their suggestions and questions.</p><div><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/alexei-lviv.jpg" alt="Alexei Gorobets" title="Alexei Gorobets at Lviv Euro DrupalCamp 2013" /></div><h5> </h5><h5>Kirill Cebotari, Front-end developer</h5><p>It was my first time visiting Lviv, and it was an amazing time! Lviv is charming by it’s beatiful architecture, narrow streets and friendly people. Usually when you’re going to a Drupalcamp you’re thinking of your presentation and the sessions you are going to attend. But when you go to Lviv you’re looking forward have awesome time walking in the streets and talking to speakers.</p><p>The organizers have made some steps towards attendees by making the party before the sessions and setting up the Poker tournament, so people could get to know each other better. It’s also a time to pitch and promote your session. I had a lot of fun at pre-party at DrupalCamp. It looked like everyone knew each other even though most of us were newcomers.</p><p>On the other hand, the sessions were quite different this time. Most of the sessions were short, so there was a lot of discussions after them. My presentation was for beginners in Drupal, so it was a long one, with a lot of questions and arguing about development - overall, we had an interesting discussion and I enjoyed it a lot!</p><p>I’m definitelly looking forward in attending the next DrupalCamp in Lviv, and see people that I met at this one.</p><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/kirill-lviv.jpg" alt="Kirill Cebotari" title="Kirill Cebotari at Lviv Euro DrupalCamp 2013" /></p><h5> </h5><h5>Vadim Malai, Drupal Developer</h5><p>I think, nowadays, there can’t be a Drupal Camp without a Drupal 8 dedicated presentation, people are just getting crazy about the possibilities that Drupal 8 will offer. Also, there was interesting publication about Migration API, Testing Drupal Sites, Panels, Drupal Distribution and others. It was really difficult to chose which one to assist. Also, a good presentation that I would like to mention, was about how can a freelance job grow up into a small business.</p><p>I spoke about Ctools Plugins and Panels. It was a continuation of Kirill’s presentation, with more advanced content. I spoke a little about Panels, and about Ctools Plugins that can be built Panels.</p><p>It was quite strange for me to aknowledge that there are some people who've never used Panels. Hard for me to imagine. :)</p><p>The city is simply beautiful. I was very exciting to visit it. It’s an old town, but this "oldness" is very beautiful and mysterious. It's a different atmosphere, and I loved it.</p><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/vadim-lviv.jpg" alt="Vadim Malai" title="Vadim Malai at Lviv Euro Drupalcamp 2013" /></p><h5> </h5><h5>Short overview</h5><ul><li>109 attendees,</li><li>21 sessions,</li><li>25 poker tournament players - 1 winner,</li><li>100+ liters of beer consumed on Pre-Party,</li><li>tons of good memories.</li></ul><p><strong>One great thing about Drupal events is that besides Drupal related discussions and knowledge sharing, we always discover something totally new about our collegues. That being said...</strong></p><p><strong>We may suck at arm wrestling...</strong></p><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/services_full/public/arm-lviv.jpg?itok=QpJQilWW" alt="Arm Wrestling" title="Arm Wrestling" /></p><p><strong>...but don't you ever mess with us on the dance floor!</strong></p><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/pp-dance.jpg" alt="Propeople Dance" title="Propeople Dance" /></p></div></div></div><div class="form-item form-type-item">
