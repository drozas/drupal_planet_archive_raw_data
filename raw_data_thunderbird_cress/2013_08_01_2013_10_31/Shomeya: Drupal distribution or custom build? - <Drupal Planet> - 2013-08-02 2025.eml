    <p>Drupal distributions are often like manufactured homes. They&#39;re easy to get up and working, they come pre-made with a variety of features. By all appearances they meet all your needs, and maybe even then some. But just like manufactured homes you often don&#39;t know how difficult it is to remodel them until you try to run pipe through the walls or refinish the cabinets.</p>

<p><em>Whether you are a client trying to save your company money, or just a consultant trying to give your clients a better bang for their buck a distribution can be a tempting solution.</em> The ability to change colors and layout with just a click and a scroll is so much easier! Before you download and start clicking your way around, there are somethings you need to be aware of.</p>
