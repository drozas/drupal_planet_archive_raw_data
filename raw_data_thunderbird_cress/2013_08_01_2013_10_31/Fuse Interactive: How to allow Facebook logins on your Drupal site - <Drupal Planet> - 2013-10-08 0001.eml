    <p>When creating a Drupal site with the hopes of user engagement you generally need users of the site to have an account. Often potential users don't want to share their email account or other personal information with just any random site on the internet and this barrier can be a huge hurdle when it comes time for them to signup. An effective way around this is to leverage third party login services such as Google+ or Facebook. In this short tutorial I'll show you how to enable the latter on your Drupal site.</p>
