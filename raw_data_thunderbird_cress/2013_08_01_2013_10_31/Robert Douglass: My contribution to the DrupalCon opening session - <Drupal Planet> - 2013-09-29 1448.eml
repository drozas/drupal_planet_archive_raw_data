<div>My contribution to the DrupalCon, Prague, opening session.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am the very mo-del of a Dru-pa-list de-vel-o-per</div>
<div>I’ve pu-blished code, and had some beers with every core con-tri-butor</div>
<div>I know the seven function stack, I’ve got it in my memory</div>
<div>From al-tered forms to en-ti-ties, oh these are el-e-mentary!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I’m very well a-cquain-ted too, with da-ta-base ab-strac-ter-y</div>
<div>and all the boot strap sta-ges through, of that I have a mas-te-ry</div>
<div>Debug-ging is my mi-ddle name and o-o-p my favorite game</div>
<div>An object can in-stan-ti-ate from this here sta-tic fac-tor y !</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For clear-ing cache I’ve got a trick, a </div>
<div>py-thon script that's really slick it</div>
<div>it-er-ates on foreign keys, </div>
<div>and JOINS them using P-H-P</div>
<div>While laun-ching sites I say out loud</div>
<div>Your code de-serves to see the cloud</div>
<div>Where sca-ling is co-mmod-i-ty</div>
<div>and ba-ckups come for al-most free</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If selling's what you want to do </div>
<div>I have the best most modern clue</div>
<div>you kick-start sales and save time too</div>
<div>when co-mmerce is your sho-pping tool</div>
<div>And now you are at Dru-pal-Con</div>
<div>where code sprints form a ma-ra-thon</div>
<div>and A-cqui-a and Lull-a-bot and Co-mmerce Guys and Wun-der-kraut</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Are won-de-ring day in and out</div>
<div>what Dru-pal 8 is all about</div>
<div>Are won-de-ring day in and out</div>
<div>what Dru-pal 8 is all about </div>
<div>and A-cqui-a and Lull-a-bot and Co-mmerce Guys and Wun-der-kraut</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Are wondering day in and out</div>
<div>what Dru-pal 8 is all about </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A web site needs some mo-du-als to get you lots of vi-si-tors</div>
<div>a task that Drush makes tri-vi-al but make sure you have sem-a-phores</div>
<div>And theming is a sim-ple task with C-S-S and Ja-va-script</div>
<div>but Eaton says you should not use  the en-ti-ty con-stru-ction kit</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now if you want some firm advice you need not ask me even twice</div>
<div>I’ll offer it at half the price because I see you’re rather nice</div>
<div>A warning stems from ancient lore</div>
<div>That junior devs should not ignore</div>
<div>The wrath of Dries and much much more</div>
<div>befalls thee should you hack on core</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am the very mo-del of a Dru-pa-list de-vel-o-per</div>
<div>I’ve pu-blished code, and had some beers with every core con-tri-butor</div>

<div>From al-tered forms to en-ti-ties, oh these are el-e-mentary!</div>
