what is DevOps?</p>
<p>Since Munich 2013, DrupalCon had a dedicated devops track.  After talking to<br />
a lot of people in Prague last month, I realized that the concept of DevOps is still very unclear to a lot of developers. To a large part of the development community, DevOps development still means folks working on 'the infrastructure part' of the development life cycle and for some it just means simply deploying Drupal, being concerned about purely keeping the site alive etc.</p></div>
