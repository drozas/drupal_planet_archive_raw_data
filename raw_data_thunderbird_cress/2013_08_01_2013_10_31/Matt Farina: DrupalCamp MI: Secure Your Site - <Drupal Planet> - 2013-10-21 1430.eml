    <blockquote><p>The 2012 Data Breach Investigations Study by Verizon shows that in 855 data breaches they examined, 71 percent occurred in businesses with fewer than 100 employees.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I read <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/09/14/are-you-prepared-71-of-cyber-attacks-hit-small-business/">this finding</a> I was reminded of all the sites I'd seen successfully breached over the past several years. The sites of friends. The sites of non-profits. The sites I was asked to take a look at.</p>

<p>This inspired me to present at <a href="drupalcampmi.org">DrupalCamp MI</a> on the topic of security. In the 45 minute time slot I could only cover a fraction of the material I would like to have. For example, I didn't talk about social engineering types of issues. I hope someone presents on that soon.</p>

<p>The slides for this presentation are available on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mattfarina/secure-your-site">Speaker Deck</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mattfarina/secure-your-site">Slideshare</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I came to realize is that I'd like to see more sessions and trainings at future DrupalCons and DrupalCamps. It's a good time to raise awareness and teach people practical methods and tools to use in this space.</p>
