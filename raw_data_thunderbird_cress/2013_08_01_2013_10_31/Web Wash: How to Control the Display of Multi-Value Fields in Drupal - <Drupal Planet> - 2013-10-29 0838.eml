Displaying a single value field is fairly simple, but it gets tricky when you want to control multi-value fields.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you add an image field to a blog content type which now allows you to upload multiple images. But you only want to display the first two images in the field, what is the best way to do this?</p>

<p>In this article, you'll learn how to control the display of a multi-value field within a formatter using <a href="https://drupal.org/project/ds">Display Suite</a> and a few contributed modules. Then we'll look at how to control a multi-value field in <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>.</p>
