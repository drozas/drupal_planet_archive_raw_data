    <h2>Task Lists Important for Sprints</h2>
By Cathy Theys
<h3>350 people! Will any of the 350 new contributors work on any issues you are passionate about?</h3>

<p>We are estimating 350 participants at the mentored <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sprints/get-involved-core">Get Involved with Core Sprint</a> on Friday May 24, 2013 at Drupalcon Portland. That's a lot of people, and we will need a lot of tasks for them to work on during the sprint. One of the things we know about a successful sprint is that creating a task list in advance is critical. But we do not want to make the task list too far in advance. Because if made too far in advance, it will get out of date and some tasks become not relevant. Mentors will be meeting on Tuesday May 21, 2013 at 4:30 to do task selection. That will be right after the session about being a mentor and sprint planning: <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/2433">Running coaches wanted! Contribution sprints and trainings</a>.</p>

<h3>Why do you care?</h3>

<p>Because you might want someone, a new contributor, to work on an issue you are passionate about.</p>

<p>Good potential tasks that might get picked during our task selection are ones with an up-to-date issue summary and that have steps to reproduce... Well, that is not totally an accurate statement. Because we do pick tasks where the task <strong>is</strong> to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1427826">update the issue summary</a>, or the task <strong>is</strong> to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1468198">document the steps to reproduce</a>.</p>

<p>But, you still might want to dig through your list of issues you are following and tidy them up a bit. Make sure they have accurate information, and that the next steps needed to move the issue forward are documented.</p>

<p>One way to tidy up an issue is to add the "+needs Z" tags to it, and link to relevant <a href="http://drupal.org/new-contributors">contributor task documents</a>. For more info on doing that see: <a href="http://comm-press.de/en/blog/bringing-people-help-make-drupal-better">Bringing in people to help make Drupal better</a>.</p>

<h3>Still not motivated to tidy up some favorite issues?</h3>

<p>There is a lot of energy surrounding a Drupalcon. On Friday, in addition to the mentored Get Involved with Core Sprint, there is also a huge giant room filled with regular sprinters. <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sprints">Views in Drupal Core, Multilingual, Twig in Drupal Core, Project Application Sprint, Drupal.org Documentation Team Sprint, WSCCI (Web Services), and other sprints</a> will be happening. <strong>And</strong>, there are <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/281033">Extended Sprints</a> from Saturday May 18 through Sunday May 26. <strong>Plus</strong>, since the excitement is so contagious, people will be sprinting remotely too, even if they cannot make it to Portland.</p>

<p>Getting ready for those sprints is important too. General updating of issues will help those sprints be productive.</p>

<p>Initiative Leads, or people active in Initiatives will be making task lists too. Let's see... the first extended sprint day: May 18. People will start to make task lists for those extended sprints soon. Wow! Portland is coming on fast!</p>

<h3>Multilingual task lists</h3>

<p>Multilingual issues that we are sprinting on everyday:
<a href="http://www.drupal8multilingual.org/issues/focus">
<div class="inline-entity"><div class="field field-name-field-picture field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="http://comm-press.de/sites/default/files/articles/images/20130510/focus.png" rel="lightbox[field_picture][]" title=""><img src="http://comm-press.de/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/articles/images/20130510/focus.png?itok=_LjMxFW2" width="800" height="645" alt="" /></a></div></div></div></div>
</a>
That focus board will serve as a task list for regular d8mi contributors.</p>

<p>I'll have to add some "needs" tags to some Multilingual issues to populate this on-going new contributor task list:
<a href="http://www.drupal8multilingual.org/"><div class="inline-entity"><div class="field field-name-field-picture field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="http://comm-press.de/sites/default/files/articles/images/20130510/needs.png" rel="lightbox[field_picture][]" title=""><img src="http://comm-press.de/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/articles/images/20130510/needs.png?itok=oNMgw01S" width="800" height="896" alt="" /></a></div></div></div></div></a>
That serves as a task list for new d8mi contributors.</p>
