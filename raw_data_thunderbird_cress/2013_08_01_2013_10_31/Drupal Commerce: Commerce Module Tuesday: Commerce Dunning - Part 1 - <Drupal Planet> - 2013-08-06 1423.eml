<p>Welcome to another Commerce Module Tuesday! Today we are looking at <a href="http://www.drupalcommerce.org/node/8961">Commerce Dunning</a>, something we at Commerce Guys have been working on for awhile. This is part one in a two part series that we will finish next week on using a Dunning process with recurring payments. </p>
<p>What is "Dunning" you ask? Sounds like a "dunce cap" that you might of heard of? You're close! Dunning management (Delinquent User Notification) is the automated process that's kicked off when a charge attempt of a recurring order fails. This process involves periodic customer communication and payment retries.</p>
<p>In today’s video, we are simply going over the Dunning Process. This is an important step towards making Drupal Commerce handle recurring payments, and we’ve tried to make it as straightforward as possible.</p>
