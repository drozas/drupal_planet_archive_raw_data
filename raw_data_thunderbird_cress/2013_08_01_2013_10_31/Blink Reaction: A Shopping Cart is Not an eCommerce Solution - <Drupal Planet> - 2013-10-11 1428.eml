<p><strong><em>I have seen the future of eCommerce, and the future is good, but only for some people.</em></strong></p>
<p>I teach Drupal. A lot. Often when I talk about Drupal I talk about how some people never leave their comfort zone to learn new things. Sometimes I make wise cracks about Flash or ColdFusion. Everyone gets the joke. Soon I'll be joking about standalone shopping carts. I think most people will get that joke too.</p></div></div></div>
