    Using Drupal can considerably improve your online business, save up to 80% of the cost and result in higher quality. These benefits don&#039;t materialise simply by using Drupal, they require you to choose the right process model. Prototype driven development is a proven model that produces great results with Drupal.  </p>
<div class="field-ns-blog-post-body clearfix">
            <div class="field-item even"> <p><strong>Prototype driven development</strong> (PDD) is based on principles of service design and agile. It builds on the strengths of Drupal: Vast amount of existing functionality and quick and super fast implementation of even fairly complicated design probes.</p><p>Using PDD doesn't require using any specific agile framework, it works just as well with Scrum, Kanban, ScrumBan or your favourite framework. It does however require real agile, if you do you projects with <a href="http://wunderkraut.com/blog/are-you-agile-or-just-faking-it/2013-07-12">design first approach</a> PDD is not going to work for you.</p><h2>Features Are Cheap And Details Expensive With Drupal</h2><p><img alt="features-are-cheap-details-expensive.png" class="media-image  media-image-right" height="180" style="width: 180px; height: 180px; float: right;" title="features-are-cheap-details-expensive.png" width="180" src="http://wunderkraut.com/sites/wunderkraut.com/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/features-are-cheap-details-expensive.png?itok=I_diD-Xl" />Drupal is a software product with much more than 10 000 features. The sheer number of features can make Drupal development a daunting task: How do I pick the right ones?</p><p>With all that existing functionality most site features are cheap to implement and this makes details expensive by comparison. There rarely is only one right way to implement something. Different ways of implementing a feature can have very large differences in the amount of work required.</p><p>Choosing a different Drupal feature for reaching a business goal often means different business logic, different user interfaces and technical implementation. All of these can certainly be customised to meet the exact requirements, but such customisations have both one time and lifetime maintenance cost to them. By changing how things are implemented in order to reach the goal can have a radical impact on the cost and quality.</p><h2>How Prototype Driven Development Works</h2><p><img alt="pdd-process-model.png" class="media-image" height="404" title="pdd-process-model.png" width="692" src="http://wunderkraut.com/sites/wunderkraut.com/files/pdd-process-model.png" /></p><p>As usual everything starts with a goal. The goal is typically expressed in a form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user story</a> and related <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2008/september/what-is-definition-of-done-(dod)">definition of done</a>. After a story exists different Drupal functionality is considered and alternatives demonstrated. Some times there is only one real alternative, some times several.</p><p>Each alternative is different in what it provides out-of-the-box. These differences and what it would take to make the alternative to meet the goal are considered. Each alternative will have a different end result and different effort to reach it.</p><p><img alt="pareto-principle.png" class="media-image" height="138" title="pareto-principle.png" width="613" src="http://wunderkraut.com/sites/wunderkraut.com/files/pareto-principle.png" /></p><p>Pareto principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. This also applies to Drupal development, where 80% (or even more) of the business value is created with 20% of the work.</p><p>With a clear view on the value generated by the end results and amount of effort required by each of the options the <a href="http://wunderkraut.com/blog/the-perfect-product-owner/2013-07-26">product owner</a> can decide which option is the best one. <strong>With prototype driven development design decisions are no longer about technology, design, or even user experience, they are truly business driven.</strong></p><p>Some times it's worth investing more to get a truly amazing implementation for a central feature of a site, some times <a href="http://wunderkraut.com/blog/the-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-the-good/2011-04-21">the perfect is the enemy of the good</a>.</p><p>After an option has been chosen the agile process continues as usual. The primary difference to normal agile is that PDD allows quick design probes during the project and pivots in design based on existing functionality. Design decisions are done just in time on the last responsible moment, with as much information as possible. Better design decisions lead to better results and vastly improved return on investment.</p> </div>
