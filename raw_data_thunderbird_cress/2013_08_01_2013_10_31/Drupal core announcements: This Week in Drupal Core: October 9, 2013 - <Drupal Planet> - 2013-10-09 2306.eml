    <p>Welcome to the third edition of <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/98113">This week in Drupal Core</a>!</p>
<h2>What's new in Drupal 8?</h2>
<h3>Goodbye, legacy BC routing support!</h3>
<p>This week's most exciting news: After five months of work, we've <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2106709">removed the legacy BC support</a> from the routing system. This means that module developers testing Drupal 8's APIs will quickly discover the need to upgrade their <code>hook_menu()</code> page callbacks to route declarations and page controllers, and we can surface gaps in the new system. Next steps: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2107533">remove the legacy menu router entirely</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2046367">fix core's routing API documentation</a> to clean up stale, inaccurate information and provide clearer explanations of the new system.</p>
<h3>Migrate and D8 documentation at PNWDS</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://2013.pnwdrupalsummit.org/">Pacific Northwest Developer Summit</a> was also held over the weekend. Core developers kicked off work on the <a href="https://drupal.org/sandbox/chx/2105305">new Drupal 8 data migration system</a> (which will replace the existing database upgrade system and allow direct upgrades from D6 to D8). Documentation lead <a href="https://drupal.org/user/155601">jhodgdon</a> also met with <a href="https://drupal.org/user/24967">webchick</a> to hammer out a plan for <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2107875">addressing Drupal 8's documentation deficiencies</a>.</p>
<h3>Core momentum</h3>
<p>In the three months of Drupal 8's <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-8-apis-are-freezing-but-not-frozen">API completion phase</a> following the July 1 API freeze deadline, core contributors have shifted focus to finishing Drupal 8's APIs and resolving release-blocking issues. Between July 1 and September 30, we fixed <strong>99 critical issues</strong>, compared to only 66 fixed between April 1 and June 30. The best part? This week, for the first time in a long time, <strong>we've steadily reduced the number of open critical issues in Drupal 8</strong>. (For a closer look at our momentum on critical issues, see: <a href="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/blog/when-its-ready">When it's ready™</a>.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, core contributors continue to work through the results of DrupalCon Prague sprints. The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?page=1&amp;order=last_comment_timestamp&amp;sort=asc&amp;status=14&amp;version=8.x&amp;text=&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All&amp;component=All">RTBC queue</a> is back under two pages, thanks to tireless work by Drupal 8's core maintainers, who committed almost twice as many patches this week as in preceding weeks.</p>
<h2>Notable Commits</h2>
<p>The best of <code> git log --since &quot;1 week ago&quot; --pretty=oneline</code> (135 commits in total):</p>
<h3>Important API and data model changes</h3>
<p>Developers take note: These four changes help stabilize our API and data model, moving us that much closer to beta.</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1653026">#1653026</a> by damiankloip, alexpott, sun, tim.plunkett, dawehner, mtift: Fixed All configuration values are stored as strings.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2057401">#2057401</a> by plach, socketwench, kfritsche, Damien Tournoud: Fixed Make the node entity database schema sensible.</li>

<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2106709">#2106709</a> by tim.plunkett: Remove legacy router backwards compatibility layer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributors stepping up as core component maintainers</h3>
<p>Core's <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git/blob/refs/heads/8.x:/core/MAINTAINERS.txt">MAINTAINERS.txt</a> contains a listing of contributors who've committed to leading the charge in a certain area of Drupal core. These folks play an important role in managing Drupal 8 toward release. (See the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/?issue_tags=Component%20maintainers">Component maintainers</a> tag for issues focused on helping fill out this team for Drupal 8. Want to help? Just start working in your chosen component's queue, and then take a look at the <a href="https://drupal.org/contribute/core-maintainers#component">component maintainer handbook page</a> and <a href="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/blog/wanted-core-taxonomy-co-maintainer">xjm's blog post</a> for more information on what goes into being a component maintainer.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2099977">#2099977</a> by andypost: Add andypost as a component maintainer for comment.module.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2107151">#2107151</a> by claudiu.cristea: Add claudiu.cristea to core maintainers for image.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Progress towards removing the legacy variable system</h3>
<p>One of the big outstanding tasks for the <a href="http://drupal8cmi.org/">Configuration Management Initiative</a> is completing the conversion of legacy variables in core to the new Drupal 8 APIs. These conversions are in their home stretch, with just 5% of the conversions left to go. Four conversions landed this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1829170">#1829170</a> by LinL, socketwench, vijaycs85, mtift, LittleCoding, andypost, dawehner, ianmthomasuk: Convert the Maintenance Theme variable to settings.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1798732">#1798732</a> by sun, Dean Reilly, mbrett5062, chx, westie, alexpott, juanolalla, Mark Carver, catch, jthorson, cam8001, Berdir: Convert install_task(), install_time() and install_current_batch() to use the state system.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2102503">#2102503</a> by swentel: Fixed Convert ContentTranslationController to CMI.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2101661">#2101661</a> by swentel: Fixed Update cache checking logic in core/includes/langauge.inc to use config system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Developer experience (DX) improvements</h3>
<p>An essential part of Drupal 8's API completion phase is <a href="https://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core/d8dx">improving the Drupal 8 developer experience</a>, by enhancing learnability, reducing boilerplate code, managing complexity, and documenting unfamiliar concepts. Here's a few of this week's commits that move Drupal 8 toward a better developer experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2105123">#2105123</a> by pwolanin: Add a currentUser() method to \Drupal\Core\Plugin\PluginBase.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2105557">#2105557</a> by Berdir, dawehner: Add an admin_permission to EntityType annotations to provide simple default access handling.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2099095">#2099095</a> by jibran, tim.plunkett: Create BreadcrumbBuilderBase and remove the boilerplate code from BreadcrumbBuilders.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User experience (UX) improvements</h3>
<p>Drupal 8 makes great strides in improving the user experience for administrators, site builders, content authors, and end users. Here's a sampling of some of the small fixes that are adding up to a big UX boost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2102019">#2102019</a> by nod_: Fixed Vertical tabs looks broken on small screens.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2080217">#2080217</a> by Wim Leers, tkoleary, Bojhan: Polish entity toolbar visually.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2030631">#2030631</a> by emma.maria | LewisNyman: Make 'Save and Continue' buttons primary buttons.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1837998">#1837998</a> by Bojhan, xjm, dawehner, David Hernández: Show the embed display in the UI.</li>
</ul>
