    <h2>Putting something back</h2>
By John Heaven
<p>Since we discovered Drupal, our content management system of choice, we've never looked back. We've built upon our business, grown our team (19 and counting!), and are involved in some pretty impressive projects including some of Germany's most important publishers. Drupal has taken us across continents, put us in touch with some amazing people who share our enthusiasm for Drupal and open source, and taught us so much. The Drupal community is more than a bunch of nerds building a big piece of software: it's a source of help and assistance, inspiration, ideas, friendship and fun.</p>

<p><div class="inline-entity"><div class="field field-name-field-picture field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="http://comm-press.de/sites/default/files/articles/images/20130822/prague-badge-gold.png" rel="lightbox[field_picture][]" title=""><img src="http://comm-press.de/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/articles/images/20130822/prague-badge-gold.png?itok=XGSu3Z05" width="150" height="150" alt="" /></a></div></div></div></div>
So as a business, it's safe to say that Drupal is one of the major factors in comm-press' success. One way that we can put something back is to sponsor events where the Drupal community can meet up, socialise, and work together. In the past, we've sponsored several events, including Drupal Con London, Drupal Con Munich, and Drupal Dev Days in Dublin. We also take a lead in organising and financing <a href="http://drupal-camping.de">Drupal Camping</a>, and we love to contribute our code too. (Not least because it helps us improve our code thanks to Drupal's stringent quality control.)</p>

<p>This year, we are Gold Sponsors of <a href="http://prague2013.drupal.org">Drupal Con in Prague</a>. This will be a very important event because the release date for Drupal 8 is coming ever nearer and there's lots of work to be done. Five members of our team will be making the journey to Prague and we will be taking part in the sprints as well as manning a stand and reporting on our experiences. We are already hatching plans for some fun with the video camera too!</p>

<p>We can't wait until Prague and are very pleased to do what we can to make sure that Drupal events large and small get the support they deserve.</p>
