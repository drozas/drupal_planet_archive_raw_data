I'm social. My values and principles are very closely aligned to the Drupal community's principles. I've been involved in Drupal closely for 3 years. I work with frontend and create modules in web-development too. But my main interest is the community. I like to take part in building new social movements, structures, groups and to develop them in my country.</p></div></div></div>
