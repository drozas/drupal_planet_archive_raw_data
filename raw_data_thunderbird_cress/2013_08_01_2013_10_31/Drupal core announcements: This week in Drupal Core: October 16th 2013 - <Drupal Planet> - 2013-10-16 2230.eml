    <p>Welcome to the fourth edition of <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/98113">this week in Drupal core!</a></p>
<h2>What's new in Drupal 8?</h2>
<p>This week saw a large number of bug fixes and cleanup task as we work hard cleaning up our API’s and codebase towards a beta release. The next alpha (alpha4) is <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/342698">slated for October 18th</a> since it has been a while since alpha3 was released and also in order to have something stable to port modules from during the various sprints/sessions at BadCamp. There are <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=8.x-alpha4">still some remaining issues</a> we’d like to see in the alpha4 so help is always appreciated.</p>
<h2>Notable Commits</h2>
<p>The best of <code> git log --since &quot;1 week ago&quot; --pretty=oneline</code> (123 commits in total):</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2109601">#2109601</a> by tim.plunkett, benjy: Update MAINTAINERS.txt for block.module - great to have more maintainers come on board. Trivia Question - benjy brings the total number of Australian based core maintainers to four. Can you name them?</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1757452">#1757452</a> by amateescu, Xano, chx: Support config entities in entity reference fields. This opens up more data-modelling opportunities for Drupal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Important API and data model changes</h3>
<p>Commits that stabilize our API and data model, moving us closer to a Drupal 8 beta.</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1589176">#1589176</a> by nod_: Fixed Use data-* to store #states api informations</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2101709">#2101709</a> by tstoeckler: Remove the bundle_prefix concept from the entity </li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2095399">#2095399</a> by Berdir: Merge DatabaseStorageController and DatabaseStorageControllerNGsystem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardening our APIs</h3>
<p>One of the primary use cases for the CMI initiative is to allow export and import of configuration. Until recently we were testing these in isolation or for a single site but now thanks to some lateral thinking by chx we have test coverage for exporting and importing between two distinct installs. Also we now have UUIDs on all default configuration which means the migrate initiative (IMP) is now unblocked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2106171">#2106171</a> by chx, webchick: Write tests for configuration deployment scenarios.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1969800">#1969800</a> by swentel, mtift, tayzlor, chx, xjm, herom: Add UUIDs to default configuration.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2023563">#2023563</a> by Berdir, smiletrl, fago: Convert entity field types to the field_type plugin.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User experience (UX) improvements</h3>
<p>Drupal 8 makes great strides in improving the user experience for administrators, site builders, content authors, and end users. Here's a sampling of some of the small fixes that are adding up to a big UX boost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2072533">#2072533</a> by swentel: Group together 'Decimal', 'Float' and 'Integer' in the field type drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Issue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1851414">#1851414</a> by nod_, quicksketch, frega, dawehner, damiankloip: Convert Views to use the abstracted dialog modal. A big win, now all of our dialogs use the same API so any a11y or otherwise issues only need to be fixed in one place.
</li></ul>
