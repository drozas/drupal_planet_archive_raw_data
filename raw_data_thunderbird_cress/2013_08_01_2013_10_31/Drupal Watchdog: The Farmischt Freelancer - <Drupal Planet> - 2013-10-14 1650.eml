<p>No, dear readers, this isn’t a tale of a sunken initiative with a payload that threatens the rest of core, though darn, that would’ve been good! This is a tale that I hope will entertain those already moist in Drupal droplets, while informing the dry newbies among us.</p>
<p>It is a <em>megillah</em> of <em>mishigas</em>[1] seemingly immune to the eroding currents of entropy. It begins on a cold November day, with yours truly staring at the home page of a mature Drupal site belonging to a newly acquired client. And there it was, by all appearances innocuous, except that it stared out at me from the center of the page, like a hibiscus in a field of Dusty Miller.</p>
<h3>OCTOBER</h3>
<p>It was this errant text I needed to exile from the page. You know the backstory: some other developer created the site and, for whatever reason, was no longer contactable. So it was up to me to discover the provenance of the chartreuse OCTOBER.</p>

        <div class="field-item even"><p>J. Ayen Green authored Drupal 6 Content Administration, Drupal 6 Attachment Views, and Drupal 7 Views Recipes. He has been a developer long enough to be curmudgeonly. A writer of sorts, a poet of metered sorts, and a rascal of all sorts, Green enjoys nature, critters, kayaking, ethnic food, the arts, other cultures, horses and Hog. Track him down @accidentalcoder or theaccidentalcoder.com</p>
