    <p>Now&#39;s the time! As <a href="https://association.drupal.org/node/18328">we announced on August 16</a>, we&#39;re looking to fill the two At-Large Director positions that are opening. The At-large Director position is specifically designed to ensure community representation on the Drupal Association board and we strongly encourage anyone with an interest to take part in the process.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Drupal Association are responsible for financial oversight and setting the strategic direction of the Drupal Association. New board members will contribute to the strategic direction of the Drupal Association. Board members are advised of, but not responsible for matters related to the day to day operations of the Drupal Association, including program execution, staffing, etc.</p>
<p>Directors are expected to contribute around five hours per month and attend three in-person meetings per year (financial assistance is available if required). You can learn more about what&rsquo;s expected of board members by reviewing the <a href="https://association.drupal.org/files/BoardAgreementTemplate.pdf">board member agreement</a>.</p>
