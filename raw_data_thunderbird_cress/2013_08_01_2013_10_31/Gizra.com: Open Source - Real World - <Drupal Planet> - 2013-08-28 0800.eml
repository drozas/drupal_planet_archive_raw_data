    <p><strong>In this guest post, <a href="http://www.itamarburstein.com/">Itamar Burstein</a> shares his thoughts about &quot;Open source&quot; - the culture that Drupal belongs to - as seen through the eyes of an Industrial designer.</strong></p>

<p>Amitai, my brother asked me to write a little something about, and I quote, &quot;Open source or Drupal or whatever&quot; - to give some examples and to show some pictures. He was very particular about the pictures.</p>

<p>This might be a good moment to point out that I&#39;m a designer, industrial designer, I mostly work with the furniture industry making very specific objects which are decided by the manufacturer, a bunch of business guys and, well, myself.  You can imagine that open source doesn&#39;t have much to do with what I am doing, but he asked, and I don&#39;t like to disappoint my baby brother.</p>
