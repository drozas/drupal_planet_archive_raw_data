Given how many pages are still not optimized for mobile (including the one you are just reading, but not for much longer), there is a lot to do. And since responsive has not been around so very long, it often feels quite exploratory. I like to fool myself into believing I just solved an problem unsolved before. That is not true of course, but at least you have not read about the solutions so often.</p>
<p>Making a design responsive can be done on multiple levels. Until now I have done mostly basic stuff. To really rock the socks one surely should do a seperate layout for mobile instead of creating a beautiful desktop layout and just make it "not-too-ugly" on mobile. This is in my plans for future sites I build and design for sure. For now, I am quite happy doing the not-too-ugly thing.</p>
<h3>Javascript is not CSS</h3>
<p>Once you feel you got a foothold in mediaqueries and mobile-first responsive layout (which is the way to go, I think), other things pop up. Your average slideshow on the frontpage can be just hidden for mobile, which sure is not ideal. Building a touch-enabled slideshow is on TODO list. Slideshows are hard anyway, since often the div-container and image size properties are intertwined. I did not manage yet to make my favourite weapon Views Slideshow smoothly scale the image with the screen-size, so I won't touch upon that.</p>
