<p>Today we'll look at the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/location">Location</a> module. Location has been around for as long as I can remember, in Drupal 6 it was one of the only ways to store address and geographical coordinates. In Drupal 7, it is just as powerful.</p>

<p>The module's main purpose is to store addresses, but when you want to display the address in a map, then use the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/gmap">GMap</a> module. Location comes tightly integrated with <a href="https://drupal.org/project/gmap">GMap</a>, and most of the time you would use both modules together.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use Google Maps via GMap, then you'll need to integrate Location with other maps using custom code.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I'll show you how to store and geocode an address on an article using the Location module.</p>
