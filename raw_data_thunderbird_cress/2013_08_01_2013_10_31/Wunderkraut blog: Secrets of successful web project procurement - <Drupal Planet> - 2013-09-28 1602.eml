    We&#039;ve taken part in some really great procurement processes in Wunderkraut. We&#039;ve also seen a lot of truly horrible ones. On a personal level I used to help customers in IT project procurement and management before founding Wunderkraut. It seems we could have a lot to share with the entire industry, so we&#039;ve decided to write a booklet on how to do successful procurement of web projects.  </p>
<div class="field-ns-blog-post-body clearfix">
            <div class="field-item even"> <div>Our goal for doing this is simple: To help customers, ourself and other vendors. Good procurement  is beneficial for everybody after all. My best estimate is 60-70% of RFPs we see today use a procurement process that is far from being optimal. We want to change this.</div><div> </div><div>We understand that a vendor writing a guide on how to purchase services always has a built in bias for their preferred ways of working. Because of this we'll use a transparent process for writing this booklet.</div><div> </div><div>Initially the guide will be published as a series of blog posts that are open for feedback. We are hoping to update the posts based on this feedback. After the entire series has been published in our blog we'll collect them in a booklet. The booklet will be available for free both in PDF and print formats. We'll also create a one day workshop for how to do procurement based on this material.</div><div> </div><div>The starting point for this is combining all of our past experience on great procurement processes we've seen. We've learned a lot of best practices from nine different countries, both from private and public sector customers. Combining all of past experience gives us a good starting point for writing the guide.</div><div> </div><div>When the guide is done we'll use it actively when saying no to a bad RFP. Today we decline a number of RFPs every month because of the procurement process described in them. In the future we'll continue saying no and will also send the guide to help the customer in the future.</div><div> </div><div>Naturally feedback is already welcome at this stage. To stay up to date this process follow me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/vesapalmu">@vesapalmu</a>.</div><div> </div><div><div><em>You may also want to check our <a href="http://www.wunderroot.co.uk/healthy-web-projects">Healthy Web Projects</a> campaign, especially the post about <a href="http://wunderroot.co.uk/blog/healthy-procurement">healthy procurement</a>.</em></div></div><p> </p> </div>
