    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>At <a href="/about">Propeople</a>, we are constantly looking for new ways to advance the mission of nonprofit organizations and help them promote their cause, reach more people, increase donations and essentially making the world a better place to live.</p><p>After successfully managing complex <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a> projects for <a href="http://unicef.dk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UNICEF</a>, <a href="http://amnesty.dk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="http://msf.dk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a>, delivering the first phase for <a href="http://tpl.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Trust for Public Land</a> is right around the corner. Propeople has <a href="/services">migrated</a> tpl.org to Drupal which will benefit TPL with a better architecture, content flexibility, more search features using the map integration and other elements that will increase the efficiency.</p><p>UNICEF.dk is an all-in-one solution built on Drupal. Propeople was responsible for strategy, design and development, including Donor Perfect CRM integration, advanced newsletter, flexible content and blog mode, campaign module for ad-hoc collections, knowledge universe, and interactive maps. The advanced donation system contains differentiated forms for non-recurring donations and monthly support memberships, general support or for specific purposes as well as an opportunity to obtain tax deductions for their contributions.</p><p>Amnesty International's web solution has been running for about 4 years and during this time it performed more than satisfying. It has created both earnings and active cooperation with users, and according to Amnesty, it still works great for them.</p><p>Nonprofit organizations are increasingly adopting Drupal in order to support their online activities. A round of other big non-profit projects, such as <a href="http://www.wfp.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World Food Program</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch</a>, or <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Oxfam</a> have chosen Drupal due to a list of indubitable advantages it has over other web frameworks.</p><p>With no license costs, high flexibility and ease of use, nonprofit organizations can focus their efforts on promoting their cause rather than struggling with their web platform. Drupal is well known among non-profit organizations mainly because of its large community, tons of modules developed specifically for nonprofit projects, and integrability with any payment/donation system out there. Drupal can also be integrated with any CRM system, and itâ€™s easily learned by non-technical staff. Perfect for keeping donor data, promoting causes and gaining like-minded adepts.</p><p><a href="http://www.nten.org/ntc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nonprofit Technology Conference 2014</a> will have a full day session dedicated to Drupal and its advantages for nonprofit organizations. The conference is organized annually by the <a href="http://www.nten.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nonprofit Technology Network</a>. Their goal is to help nonprofit organizations use technology skillfully and confidently to meet community needs and fulfill their missions. Unsurprisingly, NTN are running their website on Drupal.</p><p>Propeople is confident that Drupal is the best web solution for nonprofit organizations of all sizes. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> and find out more about how Drupal can become your organization's next step towards a better world.</p></div></div></div><div class="form-item form-type-item">
