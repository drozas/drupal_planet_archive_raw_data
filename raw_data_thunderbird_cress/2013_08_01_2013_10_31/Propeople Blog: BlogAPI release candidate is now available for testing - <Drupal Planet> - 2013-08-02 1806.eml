    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"> <p>After nearly three years, a successful chipin, and a whole lot of lack-of-availability, we finally have a semi-stable release of BlogAPI. If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://drupal.org/project/blogapi" target="_blank">BlogAPI</a>, it was originally added to Drupal <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git/commit/2f639017c467d4a0b3e0ea15ee00000f004988d6" target="_blank">way back in 2003</a> as a replacement to the far more limited "BloggerAPI" module (which, as you can probably guess from the name, only provided XML-RPC endpoints for the Blogger API). This new BlogAPI module included XML-RPC endpoints for Blogger, Metaweblog, and MovableType.</p><p>It evolved over time until the Drupal 7 development cycle, where it was <a href="https://drupal.org/node/537434" target="_blank">moved out of core</a> into its current home in contrib during the poorly-named <i>#smallcore</i> movement.</p><br /><h4>About the code</h4><p><i>BlogAPI 7.x-1.x</i> is the code that was removed from Drupal core. There's been very little work done on it, and it's still very similar to the code that was removed from Drupal core.</p><p>The more interesting release is the <i>7.x-2.x</i> branch, which is almost completely rewritten on top of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/services" target="_blank">Services</a> and is very extensible. We have plans to someday <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1760430" target="_blank">add Wordpress API support</a> to the module (or maybe as a separate contrib module), and since it's based on Services now, BlogAPI can support RESTful blog APIs as well (for instance, the new Blogger API (v3) is RESTful and we can now support that pretty easily).</p><br /><h4>Future plans</h4><p>While we have a stable release ready to go on Drupal.org, we're still far from a final release. We have a few more things that really need done:</p><ul><li>Get all the tests passing again (these were <a href="https://qa.drupal.org/pifr/test/213543" target="_blank">broken</a> recently - I suspect this is a pretty easy fix);</li><li>Investigate the differences between the Drupal 6 version of BlogAPI and the contrib module, <a href="https://drupal.org/project/wlw_blogapi" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer BlogAPI</a>. This fork was created in an effort to better support Windows Live Writer, which is still pretty widespread;</li><li>Testing the module in a variety of settings;</li><li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2055297" target="_blank">Add support for more than just a title and body</a>;</li><li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1435192" target="_blank">Write more documentation</a>: BlogAPI is pretty easy to set up and start using, but we want to put together a tutorial on getting up and running with <a href="http://scribefire.com" target="_blank">ScribeFire</a>.</li></ul><br /><h4>Get involved</h4><p>We really need your help getting BlogAPI ready to go. The big priority right now is testing with a variety of blog clients, so if you're up for it, please download rc1 and give it a spin.</p><p>Report bugs and let us know if you get stuck. We want this module to be useful to you!</p><br /><h4>Thank you!</h4><p>Finally, I'd like to bring attention to the following individuals and companies and say "Thank you!"</p><ul><li>Artyom "<a href="https://drupal.org/user/1835386" target="_blank">m1r1k</a>" Miroshnik, the new comaintainer of BlogAPI. He's committed more code to BlogAPI in the past three weeks than in the past three years combined. He's the driving force behind BlogAPI right now.</li><li>Our extremely patient ChipIn sponsors:<ul><li><a href="http://acquia.com" target="_blank">Acquia</a></li><li><a href="http://mgoblog.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MGoBlog, Inc</a></li><li>Paul O'Brien</li><li>Harry Reinhardt</li><li><a href="http://gwheatley.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greg Wheatley</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://wearepropeople.com">Propeople</a>, for giving Artyom time to work on this module; and last, but certainly not least,</li><li>Everyone who has emailed or otherwise expressed interest in BlogAPI over the past couple of years.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="form-item form-type-item">
