A lot of work has gone into expanding on Entities and forms. One such concept is the EntityFormController. The EntityFormController is a controller class for the management of forms for entities. Say for example your module Foo defines an entity Bar. Say you want to provide a form for this entity so that users can set some properties or field values. In the past you would have created a hook_menu item to a drupal_get_form callback. In Drupal 8 we do it a better way. We define a class which implements the EntityFormController. The base class provides some pre-built entity goodness, and we can extend the class to add whatever we need.</p>
