<p>Having <a href="http://flink.com.au/ramblings/drupal-8-gut-feelings" target="_blank">read a recent post about Drupal 8</a> at <a href="http://flink.com.au/" target="_blank">flink.com.au</a> I find I agree with their gut feelings wholeheartedly especially in regard to the importance of sorting out Contrib as early as possible for Drupal 8. I am very excited about Drupal 8 and eager to start using it for real, I believe that I am contributing towards it's success in the most effective way possible for me. by: </p>

<ol><li>Using it</li>
	<li>Planning to focus most of my energy towards contrib.</li>
</ol><h3>What is in it for me?</h3>

<p>Currently where I am people are crying out for Drupal developers,  I freelance or contract during the day, and every single minute I have spare in my life for coding or blogging could instead be spent on doing something that people would pay me for.</p>

<p>Maybe even thinking the above makes me seem mercenary and the arch nemesis of Open Source, but it you prefer to think of everybody as alturistic superbeings then consider that I could be spending the time working for a local charity for free,  with my three children (can any parent be considered bad for doing more of that), with my partner, contributing to any other layer of the Open Source stack and components that help me earn a living etc. etc. etc. and Drupal community would be none the wiser, I would still be a <em>Good </em>person though, right?</p>

<p>Doing what I am currently doing when I have a little spare time is:</p>

<ul><li>Mostly fun (selfish of me)</li>
	<li>The best way to learn D8 for free (selfish of me)</li>
	<li>Going to help my career and earning potential (selfish of me)</li>
	<li>I get to do what I choose and is relevant to my needs (selfish of me)</li>
	<li>Expanding my coding horizons (selfish of me)</li>
	<li>Re-invigorating skills and patterns from my Java days in a PHP context that will help my career even if Drupal popularity nose dives (selfish of me).</li>
</ul><p>Having looked at my options for contributing to Core D8 I have to conclude that at my level and limited spare time I would have a miserable mostly ineffective and not very expansive experience. I don't say that lightly, I have lurked on lots of issues, tried raising a few with patches, talked with people who have been involved and dusted of my knowledge of processes and systems. If I worked for Aquia or Plantir or .... or had aquired gravitas and knowledge from being involved from the early days, or lived in America in one of the high Drupal density areas I may feel differently but I don't. </p>

<h3>What is in it for other devs?</h3>

<p>If you want to start getting involved in Drupal 8 at this point then focusing on Contrib has the same benefits for you as it does for me (you selfish thing you ;)). If you have never been introduced to OO code and design patterns before then perhaps even more so.</p>

<p>Consider also that  other versions of Drupal are pretty saturated, as you get involved in Drupal 8 early on then you are going to have far more opportunities to find a niche module you can own, get useful patches commited (at all levels of skill)., get commit rights on Contrib modules etc.</p>

<h3>What is in it for Drupal?</h3>

<p>Drupal eight is late, being late already the last thing it needs is a big wait after release for enough Contrib. to become available before it is a viable tool.</p>

<p>Many upgrades are going to look more like total rewrites, sharing little code and design with the D7 version. Learning how to code for Drupal 8 will be an iterative process for many not something that is going to work if they attempt to pick it up in a short space of time. A critical mass of people actually doing this will act as a valuable testing and validation process for what is going on in Core right now.</p>

<p>You can do a lot more with Core alone than you could before. but there is still going to be a collection of common functionality that will have to met by Contrib., even a smallish group of people starting right now and testing, contributing to Contrib will make a big difference.</p>
