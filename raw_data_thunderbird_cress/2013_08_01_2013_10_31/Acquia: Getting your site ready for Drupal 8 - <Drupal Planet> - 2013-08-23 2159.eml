On an almost daily basis, I'm asked <em>How do I get my site ready for Drupal 8?</em> Here is my best answer. If you go dutifully through this list, your site will be in peak condition when <a href="https://drupal.org/core/release-cycle">Drupal 8 is released</a>.</p>
<h3>Start giving your administrators a taste of D8 now</h3>
<p>Significant parts of Drupal 8 are already available for Drupal 7. These modules are not quite as strong as their D8 counterparts, but they are a great investment you can make <em>today</em>.</p></div>
