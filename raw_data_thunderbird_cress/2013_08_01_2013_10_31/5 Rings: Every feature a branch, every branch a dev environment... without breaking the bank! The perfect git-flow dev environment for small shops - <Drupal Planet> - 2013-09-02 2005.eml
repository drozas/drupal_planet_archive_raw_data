<p>Everyone loves the <strong>git flow</strong> method for managing branches in development projects. If you've been living under a rock and don't know what git flow is, here's <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">the original blog post that brought order to branching chaos</a>. Honestly you can get a really good idea just by looking at the diagram:</p>

<p>Git-flow is a great branching methodology. It leverages git's merge strength to the max, and lets you focus on the important things. The only problem is: it requires a lot of development environments.</p></div></div></div>
