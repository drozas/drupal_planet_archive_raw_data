    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>The community is currently having serious discussions exploring the possibility of moving important features and central tools from drupal.org to third party sites. This is important discussions and many good arguments for and against this is being presented. It also gives us much valuable knowledge about how other open source projects are organized and managed.</p>
<p>There is, however, cause for a lot of concern as a move would introduce fragmentation to the community. It will also force a large part of our user base to not only create accounts, but also to learn to use these tools. In many cases tools that they see little use for in their own roles.</p>
<p>In this post I am taking a look at our past and the current situation. I am also presenting thoughts and ideas about how we instead can turn what some see as a burden into a fantastic resource driving Drupal development and innovation forward.</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-link-to-self-for-rss field-type-link-field field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="http://www.tsvenson.com/blog/2013/08/have-we-allowed-drupalorg-to-become-a-burden" title="Have We Allowed drupal.org to Become a Burden?">Read the full "Have We Allowed drupal.org to Become a Burden?" post on www.tsvenson.com</a></div></div></div>
