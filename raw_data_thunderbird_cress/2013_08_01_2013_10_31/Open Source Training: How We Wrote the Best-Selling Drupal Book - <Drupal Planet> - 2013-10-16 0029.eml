<p>Drupal 7 Explained launched in May and over the last few months it has become the best-selling Drupal book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That book was the follow-up to&nbsp;Joomla! Explained which has been the best-selling Joomla book for over 2 years now.</p>
<p>How did we do it? <strong>Workflows</strong>.</p>
<p>We've taught hundreds of live classes over the last few years and based on student feedback, workflows are by the fast most popular teaching tool we've used.</p>
<p>Here's an introduction to how they help us teach and how they can help you too.&nbsp;</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ostrainingdrupal/~4/z4ydWBZhs-Q" height="1" width="1"/>
