<h2>Keynote from Aral Balkan</h2>
<p>If you ask yourself what you should think of the recent revelations around Prism and why you should continue to give all you can for open-source projects, watch <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/keynote/aral-balkan">Aral's talk</a>.</p>
<p>This keynote also highlights the meaning of the expression "the experience is the product" and that user experience is built upon an entire system including the devices, the internet connection and the software we are using and stressing the importance of experience-driven open. He announced that he intended to bring his brilliant ideas and conclusions to life with his latest initiative <a href="http://codename-prometheus.eu/">Codename Prometheus</a>.</p>

<h2>Designing in the browser</h2>
<p>A big UX topic at this DrupalCon was prototyping and designing in the browser. Two talks and one BoF inspired me and gave me strong motivation to head in that direction.</p>
<p>I got told that it will not be easy. During <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/bof/prototyping-client-feedback">the BoF held by Greame Blackwood</a> we discussed some tricky questions:</p>
<p><strong>Are HTML prototypes thrown-away or reused for operational code?</strong><br />
	The group came to the conclusion that reusing some of the code must be the goal. However, transforming prototypes to operational code is difficult and requires very tight integration and communication between designers and developers. If not reused, there is still a big benefit of designing and prototyping in the browser: Right from the start we can see how solutions will look in the final medium, the browsers of the different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Are frameworks such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> usable or limiting the possibilities?</strong><br />
	Some of the attendees were using frameworks, most of the time for quick throw-away prototypes or when those frameworks were part of the final solution. However for the entire process, frameworks seem to be too limiting in the available style and structure. </p>
<p><strong>Should the design process start in the browser?</strong><br />
	Paper is not dead - scribbles on paper are a cheap and accessible way to gather the first ideas. In this step the customer is heavily involved. Paper prototypes can be refined to a stage where they can be used for first usability tests. Then designing in the browser starts on an already solid base.</p>
<h2>Technologies for design and frontend</h2>
<p>It is nice to see that tools are being developed that bridge the gap between design and frontend development. </p>
<p>Micah Godbolt presented his AngularJS based framework called <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/creating-responsive-drupal-prototypes-angularjs">Tractor</a> to create responsive Drupal prototypes, which unsurprisingly is open-source. It has many little features that make life easier for those who prototype, e.g. you don't need to search for the lorem ipsum text in the perfect length on the Internet. Instead you can specify this directly in Tractor.</p>
<p>A similar system was presented by <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/beyond-style-guides-building-responsive-future-friendly-style-systems-browser">Snugug</a>. <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> can be used for a similar purpose as Tractor.</p>
<h2>Content author experience</h2>
<p>Content authors are one of the most critical and most ignored stakeholders when launching a new CMS. Pameela, herself a former content editor, <a href="http://prague2013.drupal.org/session/love-content-editors">talked with conviction and passion</a> how easy it is to improve the user experience for the content editors for Drupal 7 sites. In fact, it is - I have documented about 7 improvements that can altogether be done in less than 2 hours and will expand on this topic in a future blog post.</p>
