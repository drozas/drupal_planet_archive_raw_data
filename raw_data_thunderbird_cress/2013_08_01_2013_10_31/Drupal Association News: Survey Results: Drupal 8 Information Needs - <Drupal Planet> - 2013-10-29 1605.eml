The survey results are helping to tailor the content on Drupal.org including <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-8.0">this new Drupal 8 overview page</a>. The page will evolve over time and will soon include links to deeper information such as technical documentation. The results will also help determine which topics need the most amplification on social media.</p></div></div></div>
