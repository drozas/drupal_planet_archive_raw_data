<p>I've listened to the recent chat on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TalkingDrupal" target="_blank">TalkingDrupal</a> about the BackDrop project, a fork of Drupal which is causing much controversy in the community.</p>
<p>Having read <a href="http://backdropcms.org/">the BackDrop website</a> and also read various blog posts there's lots of things to get excited about if you're a D7 enthusiast and some not so great things if you're a Drupal evangelist!</p>
<p>Some people are scared of what it might do to the community, some are overjoyed at its concept but before I cast my opinion here's some of  what I've gleaned so far.</p>
<h2>We're happy with Drupal 7, we know what it can do but we also know its' limitations</h2>
<p>We all know Drupal 7 isn't perfect, it's made good strides since Drupal 6 but you might feel Drupal 8 is more of a leap! if you're happy with Drupal 7 and you're already hiding behind your chair having read about what's changing in Drupal 8 then BackDrop could be for you.</p>
<h2>They are going to incorporate most, if not all, the Drupal 8 goodness but on a Drupal 7 framework</h2>
