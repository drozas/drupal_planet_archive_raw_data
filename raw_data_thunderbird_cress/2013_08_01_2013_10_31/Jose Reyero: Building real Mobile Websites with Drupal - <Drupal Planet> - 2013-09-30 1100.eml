    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>There are tons of articles and discussions about advantages and disadvantages of responsive and adaptive web design but this article won't get into that. This is just about the mobile web site I want to get, and how to build it with Drupal. Keep in mind there are plenty of options about how to build a mobile version of your web site. Possibly most of the people will be just fine using one of the many responsive themes that there are available. They work just fine.</p>
<p>But the thing is I want a fully different version of my web site for mobile devices and I want the kind of consistency on which a URL matches exactly to a web site page. Also I've been checking a number of top web sites, mostly from content publishing companies and guess what... most of them have a specific mobile version of their web site (That's adaptive by the way), using a different domain for mobile. Well, I want more or less that, built with Drupal, of course.</p>
