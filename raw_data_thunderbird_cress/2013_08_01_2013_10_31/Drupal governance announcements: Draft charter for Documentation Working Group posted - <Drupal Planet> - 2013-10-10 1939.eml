    <p>Webchick, batigolix, jhodgdon and leehunter and myself have been working on the charter for the Documentation Working Group (DocWG).  The mission of the DocWG is to ensure that Drupal Core and Drupalâ€™s contributed project ecosystem have excellent documentation-related guidelines, tools, and processes in place. The work is part of <a href="http://buytaert.net/proposal-from-first-drupal-governance-sprint">our work on evolving and streamlining the Drupal project's governance</a>.</p>
<p>We just shared <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2109331">our proposed DocWG charter</a> and are looking for feedback and input from the community before formalizing it.  We hope to finalize this by October 23, so that leaves about two weeks for community feedback.
