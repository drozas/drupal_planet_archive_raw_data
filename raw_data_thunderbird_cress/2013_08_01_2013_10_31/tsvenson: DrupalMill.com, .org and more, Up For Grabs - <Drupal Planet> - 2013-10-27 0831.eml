    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>A couple of day ago I got a renewal notice from my domain registrar about drupalmill.com. It's a domain I have owned since a few years, a domain I had great plans and ambitions for when I got it. As time went bye, I never really got around to make those plans happened.</p>
<p>Adding to that, things have recently dramatically changed in my life. Changes that takes my personal goals and ambition in completely new directions. While Drupal still will play a central role, Drupal Mill wont.</p>
<p>While I could just let the domain name expire, I thought a better way would to instead give it away to someone who can make something good out if it. So, if you are interested in the domain, drop me a line and we'll talk about it.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-link-to-self-for-rss field-type-link-field field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="http://www.tsvenson.com/blog/2013/10/drupalmillcom-org-and-more-up-for-grabs" title="DrupalMill.com, .org and more, Up For Grabs">Read the full "DrupalMill.com, .org and more, Up For Grabs" post on www.tsvenson.com</a></div></div></div>
