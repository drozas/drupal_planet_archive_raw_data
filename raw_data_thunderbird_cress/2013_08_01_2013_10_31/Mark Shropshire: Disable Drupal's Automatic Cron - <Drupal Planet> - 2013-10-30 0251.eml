    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Drupal 7 was released with an automatic cron option which is handy for those who do not have shell access or a way to enable a Unix type cron with their web host.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://knowclassic.com">Classic</a>, we use Jenkins to trigger cron via Drupal's cron URL. Because we have cron scheduled, we have no need for Drupal's built-in automatic cron which defaults to run every 3 hours. Also, we sometimes have to disable the Jenkins cron during deployments to make sure that that cron doesn't execute until all code has been deployed successfully.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to disable Drupal 7's automatic cron if you decide you do not need it. I have outlined these options below. You can decide which is the best for your situation.</p>

<h3>Drupal UI</h3>

<p>The Drupal UI is always a great way to go for confirmation settings.</p>

<p>Go to the following path <code>admin/config/system/cron</code>and set the "Run cron every" drop-down to "Never". Next, click the "Save Configuration" button.</p>

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/65229036-ac2a-438b-bf84-83b620a37ff7/81a16ae98d2c7b5714a073f02bcb91af"><img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/65229036-ac2a-438b-bf84-83b620a37ff7/81a16ae98d2c7b5714a073f02bcb91af/deep/0/Drupal-7-cron-configraution-screen.png?width=200" alt="Drupal%207%20cron%20configraution%20screen" /></a></div>

<h3>Drush</h3>

<p>Many prefer to use Drush and find it faster and easier than using the Drupal UI for configuration tasks.</p>

<p>Run the following Drush command in your terminal. Make sure to change directory to your Drupal install. 
<code>drush vset cron_safe_threshold 0</code></p>

<h3>settings.php</h3>

<p>Setting configuration variables in the settings.php is a great way to lock in changes that you don't want someone to change in the Drupal UI.</p>

<p>Add the following to your settings.php:
<code>$conf['cron_safe_threshold'] = 0;</code></p>

<h3>hook_update_N function</h3>

<p>I often find adding configuration changes to <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21system%21system.api.php/function/hook_update_N/7">hook_update_N</a> functions a great way to make configuration changes during deployments.</p>

<p>Simply add the following line of code inside your hook_update_N function:
<code>variable_set('cron_safe_threshold', 0);</code></p>

<h2>Drupal 8</h2>

<p>Drupal 8's automatic cron setting currently defaults to "Never". According to <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1986090">this issue</a>, the intent is to still have Drupal's automatic cron default to run every 3 hours.</p>

<p>It looks like disabling Drupal 8's automatic cron can be done in the Drupal UI or through the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1928898">configuration override system</a>. I need to dig deeper to test which options will work best for our environment as we move to Drupal 8.</p>
