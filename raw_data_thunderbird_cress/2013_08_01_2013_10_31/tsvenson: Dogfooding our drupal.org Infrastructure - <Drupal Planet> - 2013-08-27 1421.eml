    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>Most of the drupal.org infrastructure is currently running on Drupal 6. Drupal 7 has been out for soon three years and the work on upgrading our community home to it has gone on for almost a year now. At the same time we are busy getting Drupal 8 ready to be released.</p>
<p>The community is buzzing about Drupal 8 and motivated about getting it ready. But are we equally motivated about the needed work and maintenance of our infrastructure? Is there things we can do different? What would happen if we simply decided that we wont release a new major version of Drupal Core until after drupal.org runs on it?</p>
<p>In this post I am briefly outlining my ideas around how dogfooding drupal.org could lead to using our limited resources more efficient and in a way that the whole of the community would greatly benefit from.</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-link-to-self-for-rss field-type-link-field field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="http://www.tsvenson.com/blog/2013/08/dogfooding-our-drupalorg-infrastructure" title="Dogfooding our drupal.org Infrastructure">Read the full "Dogfooding our drupal.org Infrastructure" post on www.tsvenson.com</a></div></div></div>
