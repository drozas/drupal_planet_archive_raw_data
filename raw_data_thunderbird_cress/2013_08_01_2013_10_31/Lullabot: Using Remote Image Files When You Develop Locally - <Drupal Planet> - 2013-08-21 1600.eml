    <p>If you work on large Drupal sites, you probably run into the problem of the enormous "files" directory. Keeping your development server (or personal computer) in sync with production is a big pain, but without those uploads and file attachments it's easy to miss important design problems with site content.</p>
<p>There are lots of slow, complicated ways to solve the problem. Drush commands, shell scripts and even (please say no!) FTP can be used to download all of a site's image assets and file uploads to your local development machine. I want to save that precious disk space, though!</p>
