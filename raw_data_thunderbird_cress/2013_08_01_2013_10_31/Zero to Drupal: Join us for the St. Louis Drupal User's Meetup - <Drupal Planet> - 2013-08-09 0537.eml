    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"> <p>Just a quick reminder for those in the St. Louis, Missouri and surrounding areas that our next meetup is right around the corner (August 15th) and you don't want to miss this month.</p>

<p><a href="http://sprydigital.com/">Spry Digital</a>, a St. Louis-based web shop that's turned out some amazing local sites (<a href="http://sprydigital.com/work/llywelyns-pub/">Llywelyn's Pub</a>) will share more about how they use Drupal and discuss a recent project involving the <a href="http://www.gorctrails.com/">Gateway Off-Road Cyclists Association</a>.</p>

<p>This month we'll also take another look at a few videos from the <a href="http://drupalize.me">Drupalize.me</a> library.  Drupalize.me has graciously given Drupal user groups access to their entire video library during meetups.  We've had a request for theming so we'll probably focus on <a href="http://drupalize.me/series/advanced-theming-drupal-7-series">this series</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://chrisshattuck.com/">Chris Shattuck</a> from <a href="http://buildamodule.com">Buildamodule.com</a> has gifted our group with a gift card for access to their expansive video of tutorial videos. From setting up your local dev environment, to content management, to coding custom modules, Buildamodule has some great tutorials that would help anyone looking to learn more about Drupal.  This will be an attendance drawing so you have to be present to win (no purchase necessary, all rights reserved, void in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico).</p>

<p>More details can be found <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/311028">here</a> or click the "Yes I'm Going" button on <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/che0m1p7ifj8a1705qneq669f9k">Google+</a>.  We love newcomers so be sure to tell your friends, coworkers, and crazy next door neighbors.</p>

<p>See you Thursday!</p>
