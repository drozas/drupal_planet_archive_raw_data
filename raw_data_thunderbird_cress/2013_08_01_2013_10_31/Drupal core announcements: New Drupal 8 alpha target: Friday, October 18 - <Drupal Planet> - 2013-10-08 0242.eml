    <p>Just a general heads-up that we plan to roll D8 alpha 4 on Friday, October 18, both since it's been awhile, and also in order to have something stable to port modules from during the various sprints/sessions at <a href="http://badcamp.net/">BADCamp</a>.</p>
<p>Now's a good time to wrap up anything you've got in progress that's pretty close, so we can show the world a new and improved D8 since alpha 3 at the beginning of September! :)</p>
<p>Here's a list of issues to help with! <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=8.x-alpha4" title="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=8.x-alpha4">https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=8.x-alpha4</a></p>
