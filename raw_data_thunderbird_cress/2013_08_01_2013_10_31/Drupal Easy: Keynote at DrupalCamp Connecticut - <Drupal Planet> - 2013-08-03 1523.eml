The organizers of the event no doubt have me confused with someone else, but I'm going to show up and give the keynote anyway (heh).</p>
<p>Born and raised a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutmegger">Nutmegger</a>, but now living in Florida, I still make frequent trips to The Constitution State to visit family and friends, and I've always tried to make time to attend a local meetup. My help in organizing one of the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/28682">first meetups in Connecticut</a> was cited as one of the reason I was asked to give this year's keynote.</p>
<p>The topic for the keynote that I've decided upon is mentoring. I've got pretty strong feelings about how I think mentoring is just as valuable for the mentor as the mentee, as well as how I think it is just as important to our community as contributing code, contributing documentation, or acting as a community organizer.</p>
