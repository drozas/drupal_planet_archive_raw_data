    <p>There has been a lot of <a href="http://www.knaddison.com/drupal/new-option-funding-drupal-contributors-gittip">talk</a> in the Drupal community recently about <a href="http://www.gittip.com">Gittip</a>. Gittip is a way to donate money to people who are doing good work. The part that really makes Gittip different from other donation or crowd-funding plans is that it is set up to provide regular, weekly payments. One-time gifts are great, but a steady source of income is what a lot of people really need, especially folks who are mostly unemployed and working essentially for free on projects you care about. A few weeks back we had Alex Pott on the podcast (<a href="http://www.lullabot.com/blog/podcasts/alex-pott-and-working-drupal-core">Episode 23: Alex Pott and Working on Drupal Core</a>) to talk about his work, and the fact that he has been self-funding himself to be able to focus on Drupal core. We think this is a really, really important conversation in the Drupal community, and definitely recommend you listen to the podcast for more insight.</p>
