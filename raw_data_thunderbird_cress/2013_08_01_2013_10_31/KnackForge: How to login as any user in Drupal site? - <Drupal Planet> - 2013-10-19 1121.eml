And in such circumstances, there is a need to login as real site user to be able to reproduce the issue. Of course it is not easy to fix a bug unless it is really reproduced by developer.</p>
<p>In one of my recent works, I found a simple trick using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a> to get access to real user account without distrubing his/her account credentials like login name, email, password, or similar.</p></div></div></div>
