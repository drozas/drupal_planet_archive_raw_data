    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p><img src="http://thinkshout.com/sites/default/files/styles/team/public/Candice_Headshot.JPG?itok=Oy7B7SsZ" alt="Candice Newton" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;" /> I know that talent attracts talent. I know that if you give engineers opportunities to create good solutions for great clients, folks will want to join your team. That said, I am continually blown away by the individuals who have come to work at ThinkShout these last two and a half years. This could not be more true than in welcoming Candice Newton <a href="https://drupal.org/user/425918">(Penguininja)</a>, Drupal themer extraordinaire and employee #10, to our team.</p>
<p>Candice started designing websites and user interfaces with Drupal in 2008 for local knitters, musicians, and cartoonists. Combined with her BS in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University, she brings a unique combination of technical and artistic skills to our team. As a front-end developer, Candice is passionate about free and open source software, as well as content-driven design. Prior to joining ThinkShout, she worked extensively on Drupal distributions for educational nonprofits at <a href="http://funnymonkey.com/">FunnyMonkey</a>, a Portland-based web development firm.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're part of the PDX Drupal scene, you know most of this. You also probably know Candice's wonderful laugh and commitment to our local Drupal community. Talent attracts talent.</p>
<p>(Thank you, Candice, for coming on board! You did a phenomenal job developing the responsive theme for the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/portfolio/los-angeles-conservancy">Los Angeles Conservancy website</a>. We promise not to make you theme panel layouts all day long....)</p>
