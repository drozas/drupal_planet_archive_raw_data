        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>CiviCRM 4.4.alpha3 was released today, and there's a shiny new beta release of Webform-CiviCRM-Integration 4 to go with it. Here's what's new in Webform-Integration land:</p>
<h3>
	Contact Labels</h3>
<p><a href="http://civicrm.org/sites/civicrm.org/files/webform_civicrm_4.png"><img alt="" src="http://civicrm.org/sites/civicrm.org/files/webform_civicrm_4.png" style="width: 360px; height: 217px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" /></a>It's awesome that unlike profile forms, Webforms allow you to put more than one contact on the form. But after you've got a dozen or so, you start lose track of "what they heck are they all for?" This handy feature lets you give them more descriptive labels than "Contact 1" and "Contact 12."</p>
<h3>
	Memberships</h3>
<p>Finally you can add and renew memberships via Webforms. This allows your users to sign up, renew, or upgrade their membership(s) as well as those of their spouse, business associates, or any other contacts.</p>
<h3>
	Helpful Help</h3>
<p>Just as Webform-CiviCRM-Integration was getting too many great features to remember them all, the interface got a lot more helpful. Click on all those little blue (?) icons to find out how things work. It really does help :)</p>
<h3>
	Payments</h3>
<p>Webforms can now accept credit cards! Any on-site credit-card processor supported by CiviCRM ought to work, such as Authorize.net and Paypal Pro. And in true Webform-CiviCRM fashion, your users can pay for lots of stuff at once. Multiple paid events, memberships, and contributions can be mixed and matched on the same form.</p>
<h3>
	Brought to you by the Number 4 and the Letters A and B</h3>
<p>As <a href="http://civicrm.org/blogs/colemanw/news-drupal-webform-users">mentioned earlier</a>, this new version takes advantage of all the features of Webform 4 and CiviCRM 4.4, so before you upgrade this module you'll need to upgrade the other two as well. All of these are still in alpha or beta, but Webform 4 is already production ready according to the mainainers (alpha software on live sites -- that's Drupal for you). And CiviCRM 4.4 will be released before you know it. Why not help speed things along and participate in release testing? Get yourself the latest CiviCRM 4.4, Webform-CiviCRM 4, and <a href="http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/board,83.0.html">let us know how it works</a>.</p>
