Users will have a tough time navigating your website if the menu hasn't been optimised for mobile devices. You don't have the luxury of a mouse cursor when you're on a mobile or tablet device, instead you navigate by using touch.</p>

<p>So what solutions are out there for Drupal sites?</p>

<p>Well first, check if your Drupal theme offers responsive menus. A few of the popular base themes support them out of the box, if the theme you're using doesn't, then take a look at the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/responsive_menus">Responsive Menus</a> module.</p>
