 </p><ul><li>“Real-time search in Drupal. Meet Elastic search” by Alexei Gorobets,</li>
 <li>“Developing for Views 3” by Vadim Malai and,</li>
 <li>“Theming for Drupal - What are we doing wrong?” by Kirill Cebotari.</li>
 </ul><h5>Kirill Cebotari, Front-end developer</h5>
<p>This time it was actually a really new experience, different from other <a href="/news">Drupal events</a>. There were lots of new people that came to listen and learn more about Drupal, who knew very little or almost nothing about it. The organizers allocated an audience for the whole first day specifically for beginners. They were talking about Drupal basics, beginner mistakes and useful modules - just enough to start learning Drupal. Everyone who attended the beginner sessions were very satisfied and approached all the speakers at the end of the presentations with lots of questions on their minds.</p> 
<p>The second thing that was different at this event, was the large amount of BOFS. A lot of contributors attended those sessions from Ukraine, Russia and Moldova. We discussed pretty much everything - the current state and the future of Drupal 8, drawing more attention to Drupal and promoting it, teaching students in universities and schools and expanding the <a href="https://drupal.org/marketplace/propeople" target="_blank">Drupal community</a>. It was really interesting and educational at the same time.</p>
<p>In addition to the new methods of presenting sessions, organizers added some technology to it. In the first day, all the speakers had a phone with the presentation connected to the projector. Speakers could look at the presentation notes right from the phone without having to look back on the screen. The application also recorded the voice and slides and streamed it live on the web so anyone could check the presentation online and have access to the presentation afterwards. That was a really good idea, because there’s always a problem of getting videos of presentations.</p>

<p>It was the first time I’ve been to Moscow. The city itself is charming! We were lucky to arrive just one day before the camp, so we had a chance to visit the Kremlin and the Red Square. Most of the things are just as they are in Moldova, but the architecture in the city has a unique twist.</p>
<p>Drupal Camp CIS was a cocktail of minds willing to share their experience with the crowd. I’ve met people I knew before, I’ve made some new friends and I hope to see those guys soon at Drupal Camp Lviv. Firstly,  there were awesome presentations and BoFs (the one about Drupal 8’s state held by “andypost” was the most interesting for me). This presenter shared the actual state of Drupal 8, it’s APIs and problems that are still outstanding and that need to be worked on.</p>
<p>The camp lasted 2 days. In 2 days we had 40 sessions happening in 4 threads. Most of the time, you had to choose what session to attend, and the choice was not always obvious, you had to make guesses. Drupal Camp CIS attendees were mostly new to Drupal, so were most of the sessions, but some sessions required a specific knowledge base, like “Dependency Injection” or “Symfony in Drupal 8”.</p>
<p>I gave an interesting talk on Elasticsearch topic and how Elasticsearch is better at real-time search than Apachesolr. I expected to have an audience of Solr evangelists, or at least Solr users, and an open discussion around the topic, instead we had a “one-to-many sharing of my experience” so far with Elasticsearch. We were talking about Field Storage API and EntityFieldQuery, and how those can be used to store data in Elasticsearch and query against Elasticsearch instead of usual MySQL database. You can check out the slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/asgorobets/elasticsearch-in-drupal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Overall I really enjoyed the camp, it was a great event. A huge thank you to all organizers and sponsors, and all folks who made this event happen. </p>


<h5>Vadim Malai, Drupal Developer</h5>
<p>Drupal Camp CIS was really great! It was a good opportunity to meet people from different professional areas. 
</p><p>For example, there were people who work for government, but also those who develop social-oriented projects. It’s a pleasure to know that Drupal is chosen for such areas. The case with government sites, show us one more time, that Drupal is a really big, stable and secure CMS, which can be a good base for developing different projects of different complexity.
</p><p>It was my second time when I had a presentation at a Drupal Camp. It was exciting! It’s a good way to test your skills, because you never know what kind of questions you’ll be asked. 
</p><p>From another point of view, this is a good chance to dive deeper into your topic, because when you try to explain something to somebody, you can better understand this topic yourself. Also, it’s a great feeling when you give back to the community, whether it is about committing patches, contributing modules, or sharing knowledge, and advice in using Drupal.
</p><p>I really like “Views”, I like all the beautiful things that could be done with the help of  “Views”, and also the big possibility to extend “Views”, like doing custom handlers, altering query etc., so I decided to give a talk about this module, without which, I think, a web site cannot be great, - cannot be fully developed.
</p><p>We talked about handlers, about exporting a view into the code, why we need to do this, and also about lifecycle hooks in Views, how to integrate your custom table with “Views”, or how we can obtain programmatically a view or it’s exposed filters.
</p><p>Finally I can say that I really liked this Camp, and I’m looking forward for the next possibility to participate in another Drupal Camp.
</p><p>Check out my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/chaoknes/developing-for-views-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">presentation</a>. I hope it will be informative for you.</p>
