    <p>We&#8217;ve decided to switch to Symfony2 development in July 2012, if I&#8217;m not mistaken - after 7 years of (mostly) Drupal development.<br />
There were reasons to do&nbsp;that:</p>
<h3>1. Not-too-great experience with high load projects, powered by Drupal&nbsp;7</h3>
<p>Okay, Drupal is good enough until you get a project with big expectations in terms of response time for authenticated users. Nginx proxy, boost and memcached help a lot with anonymous page hits, but things are sometimes not good enough when we talk about authenticated user saving some nodes (1 field = 2 inserts to fields and revisions table, 40 fields - and you get super-slow node saving, at least on non-ssd hosting), using ajax stuff like dynamic forms (Drupal form ajax is not bad, it&#8217;s just not&nbsp;super-blazing-fast).</p>
