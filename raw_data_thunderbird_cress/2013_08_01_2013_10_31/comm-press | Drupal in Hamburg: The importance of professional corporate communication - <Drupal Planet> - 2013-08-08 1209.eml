    <h2>Interview with Ralf Hendel, CEO of comm-press</h2>
By John Heaven
<p>Since March, I have been responsible for social media at comm-press, a Hamburg-based Drupal shop. In practice, a lot of my work involves bread-and-butter classic communication. One thing I have been steadily working on has been making a professional impression with our corporate communication. I'm pleased to say that the penny has dropped, and I made this interview with Ralf Hendel, our CEO, to emphasise the point. In short: no company can afford to communicate in an unprofessional, inappropriate manner.</p>
