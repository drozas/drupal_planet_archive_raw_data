    <p>When is Drupal 8 coming out? What's going to change in the new version? How do I keep track of it, and most importantly, how am I going to learn what I need to know? These are the questions we're going to answer in a <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8492190560759621634">Drupal Association webinar</a> on October 22. Joe Shindelar is going to give an update on where things are with Drupal 8, covering a raft of new features and changes that you'll want to know about. He's going to look at it from different perspectives â€” as a site-builder, themer, and module developer.</p>
