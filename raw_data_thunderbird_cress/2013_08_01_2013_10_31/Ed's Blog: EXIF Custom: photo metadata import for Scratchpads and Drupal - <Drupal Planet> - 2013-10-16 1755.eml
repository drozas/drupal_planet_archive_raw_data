    In a recent paper I published (<a href="http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/articles.php?journal_id=1&amp;id=973">EXIF Custom: Automatic image metadata extraction for Scratchpads and Drupal</a>) I described a Drupal module I have written that allows for the import of metadata embedded within images to Drupal fields. This, along with bulk image upload tools, allows for rapid publication of images.<br /><br />The introduction to the paper is reproduced here:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"The use of embedded image metadata is becoming widespread in the biodiversity informatics community (e.g. Stafford et al. 2010 &amp; Tulig et al. 2012),  and is frequently used to describe the subject and licencing of images  as well as for recording the 'tombstone metadata' (e.g. <a href="http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/954/1/Introduction+to+Metadata.pdf" target="_blank">Introduction to Metadata</a>) - when the image was created, last edited, who created it, and where and how it was created. </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="P-Article-Preview-Block-Content">The eMonocot project (<a href="http://about.e-monocot.org/" target="_blank">http://about.e-monocot.org</a>) makes use of the Scratchpads (Smith et al. 2011) infrastructure as a tool for collecting, curating, and creating content to be harvested by the eMonocot portal (<a href="http://e-monocot.org/" target="_blank">http://e-monocot.org</a>).  As part of this project hundreds of images with embedded metadata are  being uploaded to a number of different Scratchpads, combined with  images directly uploaded by partner communities, and exported en mass to  the portal. For this to be technically feasible at scale images from  varied, disparate sources need to have their metadata standardised as  part of the bulk upload process. </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="P-Article-Preview-Block-Content">There are three widespread image metadata formats that can be handled by this module. A subset of the EXIF standard (Camera and Imaging Products Association Standardization Committee 2010)  specifies a method for tagging of images with metadata. This is widely  used by device manufacturers to record both the make and model of the  image capture device and also the device's settings when the image was  captured (e.g. focal length, flash duration). The eXtensible Metadata  Platform (XMP) was originally developed by Adobe Systems Incorporated  and later adopted by the International Standards Organisation as ISO  16684-1:2012. It uses a data model defined in Adobe 2012  which is serialised in XML when embedded into files. The International  Press Telecommunications Council defines the IPTC Core and Extension  metadata standards (IPTC 2010). </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="P-Article-Preview-Block-Content">An existing Drupal module, Exif (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/exif" target="_blank">https://drupal.org/project/exif</a>),  provides a mechanism for displaying embedded image metadata on Drupal  nodes, but does not provide a mechanism for mapping the metadata into  fields. The import of embedded metadata into Scratchpads/Drupal fields  is a requirement of the eMonocot project and is useful for the wider  Scratchpads community as it allows for these data to be easily used by  other Drupal modules (e.g. Views - <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views" target="_blank">https://drupal.org/project/views</a>)  and in other Scratchpads-specific functions such as our on-going work  on implementing the ability to export data via DarwinCore Archives (<a href="http://www.gbif.org/informatics/standards-and-tools/publishing-data/data-standards/darwin-core-archives/" target="_blank">GBIF DarwinCore Archives</a>). There is a comparison of these two modules (and potentially other similar Drupal modules) at <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1842686" target="_blank">https://drupal.org/node/1842686</a>."</div></blockquote><a href="https://drupal.org/project/exif_custom">EXIF Custom on drupal.org</a><br /><a href="http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/articles.php?journal_id=1&amp;id=973"><br /></a><a href="http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/articles.php?journal_id=1&amp;id=973">Read the full paper</a> (Biodiversity Data Journal)
