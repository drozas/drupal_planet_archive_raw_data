<ul><li>What is the theme of the track?<br />
Difficult question, since we are actually trying to cover a really broad spectrum of topics for all<br />
kinds of audiences. We are still in the process of deciding on the final schedule, but there will be<br />
sessions on distributions (bojan -- commerce without borders), site building changes coming<br />
with D8 (kristof), hopefully we'll have a great case study session and so on. We do try to align<br />
these sessions with DrupalCon's “One to Many”-theme</li>
<li>What’s the spread of D7 vs. D8 session proposals that have come in?<br />
Traditionally, Site Building relies heavily on contrib, which is a bit behind the curve when it<br />
comes to D8 adoption, so most of the session proposals are still focused on Drupal 7. We do<br />
have a featured session focussing on D8</li>
</ul><h2>Session</h2>
<ul><li>Bojan what’s the name of your session, and what will you be talking about?<br />
Commerce without borders<br />
I'm going to be talking about building an ecommerce solution for the global market, and all the<br />
problems that go with it.<br />
You need to deal with different languages, currencies, payment gateways, taxes and tax rates.<br />
You also need to think about invoices, discounts, business rules, country laws and many other<br />
problems.<br />
It's funny how all this represents the hardest use case you can have, but also one of the most<br />
common ones,<br />
at least if you're in Europe.<br />
I will be detailing some of the solutions we’ve recently developed to make these kinds of<br />
problems easier to handler, and how it all fits together on top of Kickstart..</li>
<li>Kristof what is the name of your session, and what will you be talking about?<br />
Drupal 8 for site builders.<br />
So site-building is a really broad topic of course. What I’m not going to do is build a site together,<br />
because that’s just boring. I’m going to talk about all the major contrib modules that have moved<br />
into core, but also subtle small modules. And also big new features that make site building life<br />
much easier. The conclusion of the session will hopefully be that Ivo should not look out for<br />
Drupal 8 site building a lot, because Drupal 8 is going to solve everything, or at least a lot.</li>
