<p>There are a lot of fantastic events in the Drupal community. One of the bigger ones is the <a href="http://2013.badcamp.net">Bay Area Drupal Camp</a> (BADCamp) in Berkeley, CA. A camp the size of a DrupalCon and located in one of the most beautiful places in North America. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog.amazeelabs.com/sites/default/files/0-badcamp-1_0.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /></p>
<p>On the first day Michael and me went out to join others at the <a href="http://berkeleycityclub.com/" target="_blank">Berkeley City Club</a> to contribute to Drupal's core. As at most Drupal events there were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)">code sprints</a> happening before, during and after the event. The location was very classy and made us feel like kings.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog.amazeelabs.com/sites/default/files/0-badcamp-2_0.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 961px;" /></p>
<p>After a short setup we started to discuss and work on different issues. We had a lot of discussions and made some good progress.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog.amazeelabs.com/sites/default/files/0-badcamp-3_0.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /></p>
<p>Events like these aren't only about the lines of code and time you put in, it is also about all the friends you make and meet. We gathered at <a href="https://drupal.org/user/258568">Cathy</a>'s AirBnB flat to cook, eat, write some Drupal songs and have a good time.</p>

<p>On the third day it was time to move the code sprints to a bigger location so that more people could join us and work in different sprint groups on various topics.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog.amazeelabs.com/sites/default/files/0-badcamp-5_0.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /></p>
<p>At the conference we took the opportunity to give some knowledge back to the community. On Saturday Michael talked about "<a href="http://2013.badcamp.net/sessions/drupal-8-multilingual-awesomeness" target="_blank">Multilingual Awesomeness</a>" and "<a href="http://2013.badcamp.net/sessions/why-you-need-more-then-one-server-running-big-and-fast-drupal-site" target="_blank">Why you need more than one server to run a big and fast Drupal site</a>". On Sunday Michael and I held a session about "<a href="http://2013.badcamp.net/sessions/display-external-ads-ajaxified-drupal-website" target="_blank">Displaying ads in an ajaxified Drupal environment</a>".</p>
<p>Up to now, we have had an excellent time in the Bay Area. We have met a lot of friends and made a bunch of new ones.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the organizers and sponsors who made this event possible.</p>
