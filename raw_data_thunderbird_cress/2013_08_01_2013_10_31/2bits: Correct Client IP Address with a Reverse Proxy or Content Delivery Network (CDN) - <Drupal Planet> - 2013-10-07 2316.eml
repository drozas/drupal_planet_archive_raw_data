    Using a Reverse Proxy and/or a Content Delivery Network (CDN) has become common practice for Drupal and other Content Management Systems.
One inconvenient aspect of this is that your web server no longer gets the correct IP address, and neither does your application. The IP address is that of the machine that the reverse proxy is running on.
In Drupal, there is code in core that tries to work around this, by looking up the IP address in the HTTP header HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, or a custom header that you can set.
