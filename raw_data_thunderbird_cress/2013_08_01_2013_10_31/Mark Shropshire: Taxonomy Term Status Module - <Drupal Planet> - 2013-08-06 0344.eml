    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>I work on a Drupal application which utilizes Drupal taxonomy for grouping products on the front page. A view displays an image for each product grouping, allowing users to click through and view products in the selected category.</p>

<p>I thought this setup was great until my project manager requested a way to easily "hide" product categories on the front page. I told her that she could "simply" remove the taxonomy terms assigned to each product in the grouping, but I knew how ridiculous that sounded. Also, she wanted to retain the grouping in case the client requested to reuse the grouping in the future.</p>

<p>I thought about how nice it would be if I could unpublish a taxonomy term just as I do nodes. After a few minutes of searching, I found the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/termstatus">Taxonomy Term Status module</a>. This gem of a module includes number of features which were very helpful to my project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Presents a status checkbox (publish/unpublish) on each term edit form</li>
<li>Each vocabulary edit form has a checkbox to set the default publish state of new terms </li>
<li>Views integration for taxonomy based views (filter on term status)</li>
<li>Configuration area to enable term status so unpublished terms are hidden. There is also a button to rebuild missing status records.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to fulfill my project manager's request by filtering the front page view on taxonomy term status (Published). When a term is unpublished, the image representing the category disappears from the front page! If you are looking for this kind of functionality, you should give Taxonomy Term Status a look.</p>
