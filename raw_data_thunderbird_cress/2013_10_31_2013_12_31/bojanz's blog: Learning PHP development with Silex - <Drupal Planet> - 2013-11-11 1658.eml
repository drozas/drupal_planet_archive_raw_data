    <p>(On why Silex is the best way to get started with serious PHP)</p> <br />
<p>
A small group of students wants to learn PHP and use it to develop a small portal for a university project.
It should show best practices, and have the usual set of features (comments, a bit of ajax, sending an email, login / logout, a small admin panel).
He/she is already familiar with OOP through previous Java work, has learned the basic PHP syntax, and is now asking you how to proceed. A framework? Which one?
</p>
<p>
I was asked the same thing back in June, and I wasn't sure what to answer. The last PHP frameworks I developed with were Zend Framework 1 (ugh) and CodeIgniter. Some research had to be done.
