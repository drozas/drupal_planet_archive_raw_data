When <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/accessadvertising/9952168534/" rel="nofollow">the  three orange Dutch guys</a> presented DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014 in Prague, they had a slide (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bertboerland/announcing-dc-31-20-v2" rel="nofollow">#36</a>) were they joked about that one should come to Amsterdam, The Netherlands by bike.</p>
<p>Two friends were funny enough to take this from "a joke" to "a practial joke". <a href="https://twitter.com/rachel_norfolk" rel="nofollow">Rachel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanvanhooft" rel="nofollow">Stefan</a> created <a href="http://tourdedrupal.drupalgardens.com/content/about" rel="nofollow">"Tour de Drupal"</a>, a community movement to get as many Drupalista as possible to visit <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/" rel="nofollow">DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014</a> in <a href="http://amsterdam2014.stichtingdrupal.nl/" rel="nofollow">330 days</a> by bike! </p>

If you come to this DrupalCon, there is no excuse, you <i>have</i> to come by bike and put yourself  on <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=zXcWB2RtxtgM.k26nzFxpyJ3A" rel="nofollow">the map</a>. While you are at it, follow our friends on <a href="https://twitter.com/TourDeDrupal" rel="nofollow">@TourDeDrupal</a> as well. Even I come by bike, and so should you <a href="http://buytaert.net/my-drupal-bike" rel="nofollow">Dries</a>!</p>
<p>There is bound to be more funny stuff coming from the community in Amsterdam, I hope to be involved in some of this and will post it here as well. There is for example talk of an <a href="https://drupal.org/comment/3974722#comment-3974722" rel="nofollow">Eurosongfestival</a> with Drupal songs and a revival of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1k-nCV6dmU" rel="nofollow">the Kitten Killers</a> so bring your guitar as well.</p>
<p>So in the closing ceremony we now have lists of the amount Megabits used, liters coffee drunken and number of flat tiresâ€¦ :-)</p>
