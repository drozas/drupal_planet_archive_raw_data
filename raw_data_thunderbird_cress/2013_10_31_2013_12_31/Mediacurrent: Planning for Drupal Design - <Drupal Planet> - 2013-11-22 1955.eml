It can be used to build simple or very complex websites. It is important before you start your&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.mediacurrent.com/l/10072/2013-09-27/fyjz9" target="_blank">design project</a> to understand what is possible so you can avoid costly implementation mistakes. It is equally important to have a plan and understand how to construct&nbsp;a workable plan to accomplish your goals. </p>
<p><span>In this presentation, given at Drupalcamp Atlanta this past October, I discuss techniques and best practices when creating a plan to build and designing&nbsp;a drupal website. &nbsp;</span></p>
