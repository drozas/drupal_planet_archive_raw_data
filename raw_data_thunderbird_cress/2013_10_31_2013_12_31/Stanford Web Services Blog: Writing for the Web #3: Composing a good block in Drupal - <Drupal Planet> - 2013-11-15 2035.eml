<h2>Anatomy of a block</h2>
<p>Drupal blocks are small, reusable chunks of information that can be added to the pages of your site. Blocks can appear in sidebars or before or after the main content of your pages. In many cases, blocks are placed on special landing pages or in the sidebars of multiple pages.  They are very handy when you want to call out a specific piece of content.</p></div></div></div>
