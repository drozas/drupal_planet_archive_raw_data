<p>During last two years we did some interesting projects, but never had time to put the facts about them together. We always wanted to share our experience and information that is hopefully going to be interesting for you. Therefore we have decided to publish a series of case studies about the most interesting projects we had implemented.</p>
<p>First of the series describes the new multisite and replication platform for <a href="http://www.gew.co/">Global Entrepreneurship Week</a> (GEW) created for <a href="http://www.kauffman.org/">Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</a>.</p>
