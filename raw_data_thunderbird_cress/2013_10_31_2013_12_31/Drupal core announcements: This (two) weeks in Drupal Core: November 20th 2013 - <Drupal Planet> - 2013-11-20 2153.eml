    <h2>What's new with Drupal 8?</h2>
<h3>Config translation UI in core</h3>
<p>We now have a <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1952394">config translation UI in core</a>! The module builds forms off of configuration schemas and automatically attaches translation operations to overview and edit forms. Whilst working on this module dozens of core bugs and DX issues were identified and resolved, all of which made Drupal 8 better.<br />
Congratulations to everyone who worked on the issue for the last six months. With 27 people credited, the issue tied with <a href="https://drupal.org/node/11218">this issue</a> for the  record number of people listed in a commit message. Here’s the monolithic commit message in entirety:<br />
<code>Issue #&lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/node/1952394&quot;&gt;1952394&lt;/a&gt; by vijaycs85, tstoeckler, webflo, Gábor Hojtsy, Schnitzel, falcon03, YesCT, kfritsche, Ryan Weal, dagmita, likin, toddtomlinson, nonsie, Kristen Pol, dawehner, tim.plunkett, penyaskito, EclipseGC, larowlan, robertdbailey, helenkim, David Hernández, EllaTheHarpy, lazysoundsystem, juanolalla, R.Hendel, Kartagis: Add configuration translation user interface module.</code>

<h3>PHP 5.4</h3>
<p>Major news this fortnight is that <a href="https://drupal.org/comment/8168907#comment-8168907">Drupal 8 will officially require php 5.4</a>. PHP 5.3 is approaching EOL, and PHP 5.4 offering us some cool features to improve DX and performance. To quote Dries:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given that PHP 5.3 will be end-of-life in about 8 months and that the PHP team won't provide security fixes for PHP 5.3, we'll have to start making PHP 5.4 compatibility bugs critical security bugs.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Green by 2014 initiative</h3>
<p>The accessibility team have announced a major initiative to have Drupal 8 pass all automated accessibility tests by 2014. For more info see: <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/366873">the announcement</a> or <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/?issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=Green+by+2014">the open issues</a></p>
<h3>Testbot stats</h3>
<p>Interested in how many tests our awesome bots run? Or how long they take? Or how many fail on average? Check out these <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/372153">Cool testbot stats</a> collated by @jthorson.</p>
<h3>Drupal 8 Documentation proposal</h3>
<p>Continuing from last installments announcements regarding api docs, @jhodgdon posted <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/371853">a (somewhat) radical proposal for Drupal 8 developer docs</a>, feedback required.</p>
