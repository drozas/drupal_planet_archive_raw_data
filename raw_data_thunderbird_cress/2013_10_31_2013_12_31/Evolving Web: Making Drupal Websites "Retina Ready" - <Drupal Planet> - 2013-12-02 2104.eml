Retina devices require images that have twice the number of pixels to appear normally on the screen. This is a bit of a pain for front-end developers. It means that if you want to display a 100x100 image on a website, you also need a 200x200 version of that image retina devices, and then you need to scale it down to size when it's displayed.</p>
