<p class="normal">I’m the DevOps Manager at Mediacurrent, so I end up wearing a variety of hats. Internally, I’m basically the “IT Guy” since I maintain our infrastructure, third party services, as well as handling a lot of general support for the entire Mediacurrent team. &nbsp;For clients, I primarily consult on hosting architecture and site performance, but I’m still active as a Drupal architect and developer as well.</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle"><strong>We're so glad to have you! &nbsp;Give us an idea of what professional path brought you here.</strong></p>
