On Monday 2, December, we hosted a community all to discuss the details and share a little more in-depth our thinking and reasoning in the plan. I really want to thank the community members who came out and spent an hour reviewing the details with me! If you were unable to make it, that's ok! We recorded the session for you.</p>
<p>Check out the recording below, and please peruse the relevant documents</p></div></div></div>
