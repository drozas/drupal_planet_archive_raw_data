    <p>Jam (Jeffrey A. McGuire) from Acquia approached me right after I gave presentation about user assistance at Drupal Camp Copenhagen with his brilliant idea &gt; Jam's Drupal Camp. A concept of having sessions Jam liked while traveling around the world and bring them online as hangouts. I was the very first guest and I did really enjoy it. It was a new experience for me, especially that part when you don't see the audience. :)</p>  </div>
