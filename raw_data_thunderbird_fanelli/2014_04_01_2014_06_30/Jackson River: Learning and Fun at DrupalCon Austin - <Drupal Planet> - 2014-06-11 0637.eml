<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">In just four short days, the Jackson River team packed in a lot of training, community building, knowledge sharing, socializing, and general Drupally hi-jinx that will impact our day-to-day work and the direction of our products and services for a long time to come. Here are a few highlights from the week:</span></p>
<h3>Monday:</h3>
<ul><li>I had the pleasure of attending the <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/node/763">Advanced SASS and Compass for Responsive Web Design</a> training session presented by Sam Richard, Chris Ruppel and Ian Carrico.  We took a deep dive into the workflow of building responsively and a suite of tools (Gulp, Singularity, Style Prototype, etc.) that can support and expand our responsive toolkit.  Responsive web design was a hot topic throughout the week!</li>
</ul><h3>Tuesday</h3>
<ul><li><a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/semantic-site-architecture">Semantic Site Architecture</a> presented by Jody Hamilton from Zivtech and <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/type-responsively-design-readability-meaning-any-screen">Type, Responsively: Design For Readability &amp; Meaning on Any Screen</a> presented by Jason Pamental of H+W Design were my highlight sessions for Tuesday.  Semantic Site Architecture touched on the importance of planning and structure to the effectiveness and sustainability of a build with emphasis on great tools like the <a href="http://www.palantir.net/blog/developing-drupal-sites-plan-or-perish%20">Build Spec</a>. Type, Responsively explored the best practices for type scale across screen sizes, measurement units, the complexities of @font-face and the techniques you can use to provide a consistent experience.</li>
<li>Thanks to the Four Kitchens crew, Phillip and I got to try the world famous <a href="https://franklinbarbecue.com/">Franklin’s BBQ</a>!  </li>
</ul><h3>Wednesday</h3>
<ul><li>The front-end and site building tracks kept rolling Wednesday. <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/viewception-three-levels-deep">Viewception: Three Levels Deep</a>, presented by Brandon Ratzloff, showcased his technique of creating nested views to display complex data. It never fails that I can always learn something new and wonderful to do with Views at DrupalCon! <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/managing-complex-projects-design-components">Managing Complex Projects with Design Components</a>, presented by John Albin Wilkins, explored new techniques with web components, CSS layering, utilizing SMACSS and BEM to create more sustainable themes.</li>
<li>Hands down, the best party I attended all week was Patheon and New Relic’s shindig at Bangers Sausage House &amp; Beer Garden. Drupalistas know how to have a good time and this party was no exception.</li>
</ul><h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul><li>By the end of the conference, I know I wasn’t the only one feeling a little overwhelmed, so it was only fitting to wrap up with the <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/my-brain-full-keeping-pace-front-end-ux-innovations">My Brain is Full: Keeping Pace with Front-End &amp; UX Innovations</a> session presented by Brian Wald and David Hwang.  Brian and David facilitated a really great conversation about the pace of front-end innovation and how we, as a Drupal community, can make Drupal a more flexible platform for front-end.</li>
<li>The Jackson River crew met up one last time before heading out at Easy Tiger for a few beers and maybe the biggest (and best!) pretzels in town!  </li>
</ul><p>DrupalCon was a fantastic learning experience, a great hub for community building, and an opportunity to show off my current favorite city to friends, colleagues and clients!</p>
