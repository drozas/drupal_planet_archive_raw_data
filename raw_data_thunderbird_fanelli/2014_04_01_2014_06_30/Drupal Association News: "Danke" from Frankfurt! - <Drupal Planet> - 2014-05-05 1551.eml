<p><a href="http://www.drupalcamp-frankfurt.de">DrupalCamp Frankfurt 2014</a> took place on the 12th &amp; 13th of April atGoethe University in Frankfurt Bockenheim. Organized by volunteers of the Drupal community Rhein-Main and run under the roof of the <a href="http://www.drupal-initiative.de/">Drupal e.V.</a>, it was the first Drupal camp in Frankfurt, which meant there was lots of work to do in advance. We, as the organizers, were really nervous and excited, and hoped that everything would run as planned.</p>
<p>We had about 200 visitors, and our plan to make it an international camp worked out quite well: The attendees came from 16 countries all over Europe and even from overseas. We had 35 sessions in 3 to 4 parallel tracks, and the majority of these sessions were held in English. The number of session proposals was really more than enough, and we had a hard time to decide which ones to  use and which ones to drop.</p>
<p>We covered a wide variety of topics, so that everyone from devs to themers to project managers to devops could find a talk that was interesting for her or him most of the time. On Sunday, we even had a fourth room with a track for Drupal novices. There were two beginner sessions, handling basic topics like setting up a Drupal, choosing modules etc. These sessions were visited really well, so thanks to Ronald and Mark for bringing new people closer to Drupal!</p>
<p>We also had keynotes on Saturday and on Sunday. Saturday started with MortenDK presenting “Twig - all the new awesome” and as expected it was a success. People liked it and we're really happy that Morten followed our invitation to our camp. The keynote on Sunday was by Nils Adermann, founder of Composer, and he talked about "PHP Reinvented – How Composer helped shape the new way of writing PHP." This session also was a great choice and a good example that Drupal Camps are not only about Drupal, but also about interesting or innovative topics that are related and relevant. In this context, many thanks to the Drupal Association whose funding also made it possible to invite these great speakers!</p>
<p>Sprinting took place throughout the weekend. On Friday we had a code sprint in the rooms of the Cocomore AG. Quite a number of people that arrived earlier in Frankfurt dropped by and discussed about how to contribute best to Drupal and its modules and it was explained how contributing to Drupal works. Some people were given their first issues on drupal.org to train contributing on real examples. On Saturday and Sunday we had a room reserved in the university for sprinting, and most of the time you could find some people there, discussing, coding and working on Drupal8.</p>
<p>Well, and of course, there were the socializing events. Friday evening we met with other Drupalistas at an Irish Pub for a warmup. It was a really nice evening with many well known faces as well as some new ones. Saturday evening we met for 100L of free beer at the Depot 1899 in Frankfurt, and afterwards we conquered the Clubkeller with 20-30 people. It was a long evening, with many many great people and lots of fun.</p>
<p>In conclusion: The weekend was awesome! As mentioned above, we were really nervous in advance, there were so many things that could have gone wrong. And in the end, we had great sponsors and supporters, 200 guests, so many sessions that we had to choose which we wanted to have, coffee machines, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DvTR_sIMcNaiW2XGeOsWA">recording</a>, tshirts, badges, everything in time, we had great speakers, the best weather you could imagine  and everyone had fun. It's really not too much to say that we all were relieved, happy and excited. The work paid off, and if the attendees liked it as much as we did we'd love to do it again sometime in the future. And probably the 2nd time will be easier.</p>
<p>As already said at other places: Thank you all a lot, you're the best!</p>
