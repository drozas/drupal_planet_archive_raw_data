    So, I wanted to do the Acquia Certified Developer exam. But I got into trouble before I even start taking the exam.  </p>
<div class="field-ns-blog-post-body clearfix">
            <div class="field-item even"> <p><span>What got me into Drupal from the beginning were that it is open source, I love open source and what we could together with open source, and I do my daily work on an Ubuntu powered laptop. Why am I writing about that right now? I registered for taking the exam online at <a href="http://www.webassessor.com">www.webassessor.com</a>, and after I set a date and time for the test, I was told to download a piece of software called Sentinel. Sentinel is going to be used when I take the exam, to check me through the web cam, checking it is me doing the test, and I donâ€™t have colleagues helping me out. Fair enough.</span></p><p><span>I clicked the link, and it was a installer for Windows. Something must be wrong somewhere. I searched the site. It seems that the program I need to install only is available on Windows and Mac. WTF! So I tried to install it with Wine (with that some Windows programs could be run on Ubuntu). Did not work, but I could figure out it was some kind of Flash software.</span></p><p><span>So I am stuck. I need to have a proprietary OS, I need to install proprietary software to take an exam for an open source system. All this seems totally wrong. Some bad decision has been taking on the road for this exam.</span></p><p><span>Story will continue (hopefully).</span></p> </div>
