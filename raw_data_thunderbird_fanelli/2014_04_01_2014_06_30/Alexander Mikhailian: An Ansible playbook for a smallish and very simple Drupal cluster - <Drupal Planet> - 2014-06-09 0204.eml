It is designed for high-availability: failure of one server is not critical. However, there is no automatic failover configuration. Instead, manual recovery is possible within minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Load balancers run varnish. Its configuration file takse into account the context_breakpoint cookie that's used to implement <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/19/responsive-design-adaptive/">responsive delivery</a>. The same server also has memcached.</li>
<li>Application servers run nginx and a recent php5-fpm through unix sockets. There's also drush. The filesystem is shared through glusterfs. </li>
<li>MariaDb is configured in master-slave mode on database servers. They also run Apache Solr.</li>
</ul>

<p>All servers set up exim to work as smarthost, sending mails through gmail. In practice, gmail limits outgoing emails to a few thousands per day, so it is better to replace it by a dedicated solution such as Mailchimp. There's also newrelic for server monitoring on all servers.</p>

<p>The playbook assumes that all servers have public IPs on eth0 and sit in the private network on eth1.</p>

<p>For the rest, check the code in <a href="https://github.com/mikhailian/drupal-cluster-playbook">github</a>.</p>
