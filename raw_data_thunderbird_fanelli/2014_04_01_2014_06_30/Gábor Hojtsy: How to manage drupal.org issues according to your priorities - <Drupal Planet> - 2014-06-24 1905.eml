Each issue has a priority value which can be one of Critical, Major, Normal and Minor. Even more interesting is the tagging system we use with some commonly used tags like 'beta blocker' or 'beta target' or 'revisit before release' which add extra priority on top of the single value field. The drupal.org issues however don't lend themselves to supporting working on <strong>your</strong> priorities. Here are some options and tools I used so far that help solve this issue.</p>
