<p>America’s online freedoms are under attack. FCC Chairman Wheeler wants to give Internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon the power to block access to the Web unless content providers pay an extra fee. The Internet pipeline will be divided into different streams of varying quality, and sites will be required to pay premiums based on the performance of their users connections.</p>
<h3>Net neutrality or bust</h3>
<p>The demise of net neutrality will give big companies with lots of money premium access to digital networks and make it difficult for independent communities to thrive. The Web’s openness makes it possible for open source projects with meager funding, like Drupal, to compete against wealthy, established brands such as Adobe. If Drupal.org had to pay premiums for Internet access, it may have never been feasible to exist alongside companies with enourmous budgets.</p>
<p>Chairman Wheeler’s so-called “fast lane” proposal for Internet traffic will give Internet service providers unprecedented power to control our access to culture and politics. The magnitude of this issue has driven me to spend the past few weeks scouring the news, signing petitions and telling everyone I know about the situation.</p>
<h3>Taking to the streets</h3>
<p>I even went as far as trying to mastermind a political demonstration in downtown San Francisco to tell our senators that net neutrality is important and to demand the FCC to keep it that way. The event was essentially a flop, but technically, I pulled it off. At the very least, I got to speak with a representative from Senator Feinstein’s office who came down to chat with me in the plaza.</p>
<p><img class="imagecache-500px_wide" src="http://www.chapterthree.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/500px_wide/0512140934b.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>Organizing the demonstration was an excellent learning experience, regardless the outcome. It pushed me out of my comfort zone while giving me a richer perspective on the issue and democracy in general. It also made me think about better ways to influence change by leveraging my strengths instead of naively rush into the unknown.</p>
<p>My manic, sleep deprived dreams of political manifesto were, if anything, a cry for help. It was a plea for the nation to band together and tell our representatives that keeping the Web open is important. We must demand that our representatives urge the FCC to uphold net neutrality or lose the promise of a connected world.</p>
<h3>Only YOU can save net neutrality</h3>
<p>Take action now and <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/tellfcc/">sign this petition to the FCC</a> telling them that net neutrality is vital to the web’s future. Internet access is now a fundamental part of our society and it is necessary for a vibrant, healthy economy. We are increasingly dependent on the Web to distribute information, exchange ideas, and create new tools. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1aa-3HFUMc">Senator Al Franken is right</a> about the net neutrality debate being the civil rights issue of our time. We can’t let huge media monopolies take control of such an influential tool.</p>
<p>We at Chapter Three have taken a stand on the issue by signing the <a href="http://www.internetdeclaration.org">Declaration of Internet independence</a>. Encourage your employers to support freedom online by doing the same. <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do">Check out this list of resources</a> from the FreePress organization to discover even more ways to help.</p>
<p>Can you think of any more ways to reach out? What have you already done to protect the integrity of the Web and what tactics do you find most effective? I believe we can live in the world of our dreams but not without fighting for it first.</p>
