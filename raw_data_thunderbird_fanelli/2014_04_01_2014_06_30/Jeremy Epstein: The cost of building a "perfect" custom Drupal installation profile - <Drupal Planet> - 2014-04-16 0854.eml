    <p>With virtually everything in Drupal, there are two ways to accomplish a task: <a href="http://getlevelten.com/blog/ian-whitcomb/dont-be-noob-top-5-most-common-drupal-beginner-mistakes">The Easy Way</a>, or <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/the-drupal-way">The Right&trade; Way</a>.
</p>
<p>Deploying a new Drupal site for the first time is no exception. The Easy Way &ndash; and almost certainly the most common way &ndash; is to simply copy your local version of the database to production (or staging), along with user-uploaded files. (Your code needs to be deployed too, and The Right&trade; Way to deploy it is <a href="https://drupal.org/node/803746">with version-control</a>, which you're hopefully using&hellip; but that's another story.)
</p>
<p>The Right&trade; Way to deploy a Drupal site for the first time (at least since Drupal 7, and "with hurdles" since Drupal 6), is to <strong>only</strong> deploy your code, and to reproduce your database (and ideally also user-uploaded files) with a <a href="http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/16233/create-a-repeatable-drupal-install">custom installation profile</a>, and also with significant <a href="http://codekarate.com/daily-dose-of-drupal/drupal-7-features-module-deployment">help from the Features module</a>.

</p>
<p>I've been churning out quite a lot of Drupal sites over the past few years, and I must admit, the vast majority of them were deployed The Easy Way. Small sites, single developer, quick turn-around. That's usually the way it rolls. However, I've done some work that's required custom installation profiles, and I've also been trying to embrace Features more; and so, for my most recent project &ndash; despite it being "yet another small-scale, one-dev site" &ndash; I decided to go the full hog, and to build it 100% The Right&trade; Way, just for kicks.
</p>
<p>Does it give me a warm fuzzy feeling, as a dev, to be able to install a perfect copy of a new site from scratch? Hell yeah. But does that warm fuzzy feeling come at a cost? Hell yeah.</p>
