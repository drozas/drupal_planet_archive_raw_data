We're excited about the official announcement of training at DrupalCon which is held on the Monday before the conference on Monday, June 2. We have two courses on offer which we think you'll love. One will get you started evaluating your designs with users, and how to conduct usability testing. One will help ensure your site or application is secure which is increasingly important for sites of all sizes. </p></div>
