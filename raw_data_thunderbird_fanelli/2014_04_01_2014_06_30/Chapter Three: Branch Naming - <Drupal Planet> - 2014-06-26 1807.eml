    <p dir="ltr">Having a good workflow is important. A workflow that is repeatable and consistent makes your life easier.</p><br />
<br />
<p dir="ltr">I create a branch for every Drupal core issue that I work on and use the issue’s node id as a branch name. For example:</p><br />
<br />
<p dir="ltr"><code>git checkout -b 2284103</code></p><br />
<br />
<p dir="ltr">This system has many advantages, especially if you work on multiple patches. It’s also quite easy to implement. If you are reading an issue on <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal.org</a>, you already have the branch name. From there, it’s as simple as copying and pasting from the url. If you have <a href="https://gist.github.com/trey/2722934#bash-fanciness">git shell completion</a> installed, you can change your command prompt so that you know which issue you are working on by glancing at the terminal prompt.</p>
