Why the long break? Well, both the configuration and content system was in heavy development with changes and I did not want to get you content that would be quickly outdated. Hopefully now it is safer to talk about what is going to end up in Drupal 8 for these systems. If not, well, then I’m sorry. We’ll cover configuration first because that is more baked.</p>
<h3>The Drupal 8 configuration system is a boon for language</h3>
<p>As I wrote <a href="http://hojtsy.hu/blog/2013-sep-13/drupal-8-multilingual-tidbits-14-intro-content-and-configuration">in the previous article in the series</a>, configuration is now encompassing lots of settings that were variables or used custom settings storage in Drupal 7. The biggest value for non-English and multilingual sites in Drupal 8 of the configuration changes is that now a common system is used to manage your site name, email text settings through to views, field settings, entity form displays, etc. We can introduce language and translation support in a way that modules will need to plan with. It is not just an optional contributed add-on but a core feature.</p>
