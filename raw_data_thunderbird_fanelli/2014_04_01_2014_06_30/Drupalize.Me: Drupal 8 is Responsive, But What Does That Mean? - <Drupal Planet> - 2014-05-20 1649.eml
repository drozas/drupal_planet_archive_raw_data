"Mobile friendly," "responsive," "squishy" — all words to describe the behavior a site invokes on different devices or different screen sizes. Mobile friendly can also mean content first. From a big screen to a little screen, things look different. Images change sizes, menu items become drop-downs, columns are pushed around to locations that make sense with content being the supreme real-estate. So if Drupal is mobile friendly out of the box that must mean I am 100% good to go with all my websites using Drupal 8. We wish. Drupal 8 is coming along and looking pretty sweet, but it is still Drupal and not a magic unicorn. This blog post is not going to get into the nitty gritty of how responsive websites work, but we're going to take a closer look at how two new core modules can make it easier to build a responsive theme. </p></div></div></div>
