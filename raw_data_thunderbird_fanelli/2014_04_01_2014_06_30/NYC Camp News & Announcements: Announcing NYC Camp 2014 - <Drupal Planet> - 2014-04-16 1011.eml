    <p>NYC Camp (aka 'nice camp') is an annual 4 day mini Drupal conference held in NYC dedicated to Drupal learning and contribution. Best of all it's completely free and volunteer powered! This past year we had a spectacular event packed with trainings, sessions, summits and sprints. We've got a great event in the works and expect NYC Camp 2014 to rock even harder than last year!</p>
