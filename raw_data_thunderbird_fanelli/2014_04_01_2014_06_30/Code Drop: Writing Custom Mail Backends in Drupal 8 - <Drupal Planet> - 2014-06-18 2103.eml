Blocks, fields, widgets, formatters and more all have their own annotations and now so do mail backends. </span></p>
<p>Emails sent using Mime Mail come through in a different format and break the Drupal 7 TestingMailSystem. Mime Mail should probably provide its own testing class but previously I wrote my own. Lets take a look at what a port of that class may look like in Drupal 8.</p>
