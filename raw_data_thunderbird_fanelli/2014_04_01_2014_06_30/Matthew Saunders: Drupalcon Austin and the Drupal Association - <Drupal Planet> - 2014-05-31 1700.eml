Seven years.  When I entered into the Drupal community back then, I had no real idea that this would become the focus of how I chose to make my living.  I had no idea that, mostly, twice a year I would join with other like minded people.  I didn't know that I would find myself in a leadership position in the community.  I didn't know that I'd end up helping lead companies.  What I did know was that I was working with a software project that made it easier for me to do my job.</p></div></div></div><!-- google_ad_section_end --><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-2 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/drupal/taxonomy/term/6">drupal</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/drupal/taxonomy/term/568">drupalcon</a></div><div class="field-item even"><a href="/drupal/category/tags/austin">austin</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/drupal/category/tags/drupal-association">drupal association</a></div></div></div>
