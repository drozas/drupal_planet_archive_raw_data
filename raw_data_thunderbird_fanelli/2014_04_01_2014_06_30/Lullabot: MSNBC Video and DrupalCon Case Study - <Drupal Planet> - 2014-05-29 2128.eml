  <p>In the past 8 years, we've had the privilege of working on some amazing high-profile projects. We helped extend the reach of Drupal, building some of the earliest household name Drupal websites including projects for MTV, Sony Music, FastCompany, WWE, Martha Stewart, Harvard University, and many more. Late in 2012 we were approached about what would become one of the most ambitious projects we've ever launched.</p>
