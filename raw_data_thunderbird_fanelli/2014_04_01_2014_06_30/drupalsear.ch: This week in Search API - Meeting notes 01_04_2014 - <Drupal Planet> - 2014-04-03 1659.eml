    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>On Tuesday, April first we had our first Search API Online meeting using Google Hangout. The following is a result of what was decided and said. It's also a start of this week in Search API so that we allow you to follow along.</p>
<h2>What have we done</h2>
<p>Frederick fixed the batch process, needs to be tested<br />
During Drupal Dev Days we made 322 commits<br />
Heaviest hours were from 09:00 till 19:00 and then it went up again from 22:00 till 24:00. Thanks to freblasty we even had commits during the middle of the night, 9 of them at 04:00.<br />
Wednesday was our most productive day with 75 commits. Saturday was our low point with only 36 commits, I guess that has something to do with the party on Friday evening…!<br />
20834 lines were added, 11996 were removed<br />
In total we had 15 contributors!!!!<br />
A blog post with more details will be posted soon.<br /><a href="http://drupalsear.ch/rocketship/all/all">http://drupalsear.ch/rocketship/all/all</a> now features the issues from the sandbox also. If you see issues in Needs Review, please go in and review and/or put your opinion.</p>
<h2>What will we do</h2>
<p>In General more tests for the processors is our main focus<br />
The indexing logic needs to be reviewed and tested<br />
We’ll move to the proper Search API project once basic functionality is working and we want to work on features.<br />
freblasty is going to move all the issues from the google doc to the sandbox issue queue.<br />
drunkenmonkey will review if the information is clear enough on the main Search API Module page so that people are guided towards best practices and they can join the effort.<br />
Nick_vh will figure how search api tests quickly locally using drupal.org docker images.<br />
Nick_vh will figure out how to proceed with a this week in Search API blog post (which is what you are more or less reading right now).<br />
Nick_vh will register drupalsear.ch and link d8searchapi.acquia.com to it.</p>
<h2>For your information</h2>
<p>freblasty has a holiday and seems he has time to work on some harder issues. He needs some cheering!<br />
We decided that we'll talk about multiple entity types per index next meeting.<br />
Before committing/pushing, we will always run tests.</p>
