    <p>Following the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2246699">addition of PSR-4 support to Drupal 8</a>, the next step will be to <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2247991">move all Drupal 8 core module code to PSR-4 (Issue #2247991)</a>.</p>
<p>Since this change is significant and will require the reroll of many existing patches, a potential commit window for is scheduled for May 27, to give contributors a chance to prepare for this change and update their patches before <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Austin</a>. Drupal 8.0-alpha12 will now be released on May 28 to allow time for this change. (If the patch for <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2247991">Issue #2247991</a> is not ready by May 27, it will be postponed until after DrupalCon.)</p>
<p>After this change, the deprecated PSR-0 directory structure will continue to work for contributed modules, but this support will be dropped before the first beta in <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2247287">Issue #2247287</a>, so you should also update your Drupal 8 contributed modules to PSR-4.</p>
