The new members are Mike Lamb of Pfizer and Rob Gill of NBCUniversal. They are the first members of the Drupal Association board to bring the perspective of large end users of Drupal.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled to be part of such an important component of the Drupal community,” said Lamb, who works at Pfizer as the director of Marketing Technology Strategy. “It’s a great opportunity to give back to the project and impact its future in a meaningful way.”</p>
<p>Rob Gill is Vice President of Media Products at NBCUniversal and oversees the digital properties for the company and its various content brands. Gill is a long time advocate of open source solutions.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to helping Drupal and the Drupal Association grown within the enterprise,” said Gill. “It’s great to work with a team of people on the Drupal Association board who are passionate about Drupal’s success.”</p>
<p>The board of directors oversees the activities of the Drupal Association, which hosts and maintains Drupal.org and runs programs focused on growing the community and Drupal adoption.</p>
<p>Both Lamb and Gill will participate in board activities at DrupalCon Austin, which kicks off next Monday.
