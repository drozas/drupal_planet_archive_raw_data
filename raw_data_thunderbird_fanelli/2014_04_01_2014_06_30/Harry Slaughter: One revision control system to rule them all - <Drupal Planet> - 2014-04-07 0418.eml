    <p>The first revision control system I ever used was called RCS. It was the pre-cursor to CVS and stored all revision data locally. It was nifty but very limited and not suited for group development. CVS was the first shared revisioning system I used. It was rock solid, IMHO. But it had a few big problems, like the inability to rename or move files. Everything had to be deleted and re-added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since those days, I&#39;ve used several other revisioning systems: Perforce, Bitkeeper, Clearcase, Subversion and GIT.</p><p><a href="http://devbee.com/2014/04/one-revision-control-system-to-r" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
