<p>I've had a few occasions recently that called for a good deal of javascript to process and display data, and angular really is a great fit for that. Not only is angular a great fit, but since it's pretty painless to build up various content types in Drupal, and then query against those and prepare data to feed to an angular application, pairing Drupal with Angular has been productive, fun, and interesting.</p>
