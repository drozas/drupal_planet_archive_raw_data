DrupalCon Amsterdam is next, and we’re trying match the success of Austin… but for that, we’re going to need your help.</p>
<p>Submit your <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/submit-session">your best sessions ideas</a> by Friday, 13 June by midnight - that’s tomorrow! The same thing goes for training sessions and scholarship/grant applications. The deadline is coming up quickly, so make sure you send in your submissions before it’s too late. (Psst.... grab some karma and spread the word!)</p>
<p>DrupalCon wouldn’t be what it is without the community, which is why we have scholarships and grants.. If you want to come to DrupalCon Amsterdam but can’t afford some or all of the trip, <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/grants-and-scholarships">apply by Friday for financial aid</a> and tell us why you need to be in Amsterdam and hopefully we can help you out!</p>
<p>Lastly, DrupalCon is a great place to gain Drupal knowledge and experience. That couldn’t happen without training, so make sure that you <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/training">submit your training proposals</a> and opportunities for the European Drupal community. Again, this is all due on Friday, 13 June.</p>
<p>To recap, got a great idea for a session, training, or need help coming to Amsterdam? Make sure you submit by Friday at 23:59 Amsterdam local time! We’ll be making big announcements the first two weeks of June. Don't worry, for those not selected to present or not granted a scholarship, the earlybird ticket rate extends until 11 July.</p>
<p>See you in Amsterdam!</p>
