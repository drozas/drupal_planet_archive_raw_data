<p>
	During the 2014 <a href="/szeged2014.drupaldays.org">Drupal Devs Days</a> in Szeged Hungary, Bram Goffings (aka <a href="http://drupal.org/user/172527">aspilicious</a>) and I had a chat about his experience upgrading <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ds">Display Suite</a> early on and maintaining it during the ongoing Drupal 8 development cycle. He says it was a great learning experience and that it is time for everyone else to start their upgrades in preparation for the Drupal 8 beta release.
