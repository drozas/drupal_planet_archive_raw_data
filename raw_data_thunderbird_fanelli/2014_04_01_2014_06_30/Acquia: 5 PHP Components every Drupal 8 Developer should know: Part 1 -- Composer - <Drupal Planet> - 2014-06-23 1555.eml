We’re not really feeling the full effects of those changes quite yet, but with time, I believe the implications of Drupal 8’s new direction will have an amazing impact for the good of our community. A big part of those changes was the decision to adopt outside code. The 180 degree turn from a primarily NIH (Not Invented Here) culture to a PFE/PIE (Proudly Found Elsewhere/Proudly Invented Elsewhere) culture has been shocking and dramatic.</p></div>
