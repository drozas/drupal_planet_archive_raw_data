    <p>It’s going to happen. We’re not exactly sure when, but it is likely (or at least possible!) that Drupal 8 will have a full release in the final quarter of 2014. With any major version update we typically get calls from at least a few panicked clients wondering what they need to do. “do we have to upgrade?”, “will my version continue to be supported?” or “IS MY SITE GOING TO EXPLODE?”</p>
