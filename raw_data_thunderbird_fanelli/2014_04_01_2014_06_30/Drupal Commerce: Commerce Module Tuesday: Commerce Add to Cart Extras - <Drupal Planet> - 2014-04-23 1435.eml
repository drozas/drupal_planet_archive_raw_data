<p><a href="http://dgo.to/commerce_add_to_cart_extras">Commerce Add to Cart Extras</a> is a great little module that provides the ability to turn a product listing view into an add to cart form. It does this by providing a new field that you add to a view which provides a quantity text box and makes the entire view an add to cart form. This differs from the existing “Add to Cart” field provided by commerce, which allows you to add a single item to the cart from a list.</p>
<p>This allows you to do some useful things such as creating a bulk order form which lists some or all of the products on your site, allowing customers to enter a quantity directly for the products they want. Or, you can utilize standard Views functionality to create another add to cart form for wholesalers on products with several attributes allowing them to add quantities of each individual product quickly and easily. Let’s take a brief look at how we can do this.  Just download and enable the module, and you’re ready to get started.</p>
