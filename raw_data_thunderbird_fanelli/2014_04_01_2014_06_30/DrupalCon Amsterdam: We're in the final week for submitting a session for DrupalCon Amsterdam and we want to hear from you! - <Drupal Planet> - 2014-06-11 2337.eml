<p>Drupal 8 is will be the major topic for the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/tracks#coding">Coding and Development</a> track. But we're not only looking for Drupal or Drupal 8 content. As developers, we need to be up to date on the best practices and industry standards, so sessions on behavioral development, testing and software design, among others, will be closely considered.</p>
<p><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/users/pcambra">Pedro Cambra</a>, <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/users/crell">Larry Garfield</a> and <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/users/cam8001">Cameron Tod</a> will be happy to answer any questions you might have regarding the submission and selection processes. Do you have knowledge to share with the community? Go ahead and <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/submit-session">submit your session!</a></p>
