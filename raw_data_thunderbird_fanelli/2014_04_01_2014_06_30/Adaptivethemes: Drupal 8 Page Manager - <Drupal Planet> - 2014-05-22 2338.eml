<p>From the project page:</p>

<blockquote><p>It supports the creation of new pages, and allows placing blocks within that page.<br />
Like Drupal 7's Page Manager, it provides a concept of "page variants", each with their own selection conditions.<br />
Additionally, it can be used to take over an existing page, like overriding /node/% to change what is displayed when viewing a node. It utilizes the core Conditions, Context, and Blocks APIs to accomplish this.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'll be keeping a close eye on this project, especially with regards to responsive design in the eventual Drupal 8 Panels module that, at least at this stage I assume, will provide the actual layouts for Page Manager pages.</p>

<p>I'm pretty excited about this project and encourage anyone interested in D8 Panels and Page Manager to jump onboard and lend a helping hand.</p>
