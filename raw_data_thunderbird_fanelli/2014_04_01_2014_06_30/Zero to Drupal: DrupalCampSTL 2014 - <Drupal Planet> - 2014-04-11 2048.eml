The final <a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/#nav-speakers">sessions</a> were announced last week and it's shaping up to be an awesome experience for a wide variety of folks looking to learn more about Drupal.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/geerlingguy">@geerlingguy</a>, myself, and a few other great folks from the STLDUG began discussing the idea of hosting St. Louis' first ever DrupalCamp last year, we decided that we wanted to gear our first camp towards those who were just getting started with Drupal. I've been a part of the STLDUG for several years now and two things have been constant: newcomers looking to learn more about Drupal, and a strong need for Drupal developers in the St. Louis area.  What's more is that the community of developers, stakeholders, and hobbyists in this city is nothing short of amazing. Naturally, it only made sense to put together a camp that would allow us to share our experiences and expertise with those wanting to learn.</p>

<p>So if you're in or around the St. Louis area and you're looking to learn more about Drupal, check out the <a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/#nav-speakers">sessions</a>, <a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/register">register</a> today, and I look forward to meeting you on April 26th!</p>
