    <p>The title says it all. I love to travel, meet new people, experience local community and share my knowledge. This is edition 2014.<br />
Pinpoint yourself onto the map if you are interested in any of the trainings, doesn't matter if you are an individual or a company.<br />
If you can host me (couch), show me around your city, and find the venue for training, you will get discounts.</p>
