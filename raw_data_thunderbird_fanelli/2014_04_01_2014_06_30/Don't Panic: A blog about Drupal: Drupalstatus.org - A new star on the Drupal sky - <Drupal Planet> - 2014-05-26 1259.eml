    <p>For long, I've been using Droptor to get an overview of all my Drupal sites and it's a powerful service that not only gives you an overview but also statistics of your content and several checklists (security, performance, SEO and health) to see how your website is doing. It's great and much needed, but there isn't happening a lot at Droptor. I've submitted several suggestions on how to improve their service and they have applauded them, saying that these suggestions will come in newer versions of Droptor but then ... nothing.</p>
