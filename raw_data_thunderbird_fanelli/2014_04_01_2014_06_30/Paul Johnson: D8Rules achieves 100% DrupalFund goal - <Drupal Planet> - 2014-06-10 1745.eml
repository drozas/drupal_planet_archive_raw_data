A momentum which you will rarely see elsewhere. There's an important lesson to be learned here, but I will save that for the end.</p>
<p>Over the past week something quite remarkable happened. Whilst at DrupalCon I met <a href="https://drupal.org/u/yesct">Cathy Theys</a>, one of the leading forces in Drupal 8 development. She flagged concerns with me that the <a href="https://www.drupalfund.us/project/d8rules-support-rules-module-drupal-8">D8Rules DrupalFund</a>, a <strong>first round of crowd funding</strong> development of Drupal 8 version of rules, had just 7 days remaining and that just $5000 of the target $15000 had been pledged. If they didn't hit $15K they would get nothing.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gEH291mq48Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>7 days and counting</h2>
<p>As DrupalCon social media lead and with access to Drupal's Twitter account I broadcast the message to as wide an audience as possible. It's fair to say that there was an immediate uplift in pledges, but that wained. Drupalers love to prevaricate, leave things until the last moment. I've seen that so many times with DrupalCon session submissions.</p>

<p>Fast forward 5 days and I noticed something quite worrying, 2 days to go and over $6000 in pledges required. I decided take somewhat firmer action. <strong>"If #Drupal8Rules doesn't reach 100% by 2 days time they don't get $8605 they get NOTHING"</strong></p>

<p>The sense of urgency had started to hit the Drupal community. Amazingly just 6 short hours later D8Rules was within sight of reaching 100% funding.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><p>Only $1100 left to reach $15k target <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Drupal8Rules&amp;src=hash">#Drupal8Rules</a> <a href="http://t.co/GCUpab0dnW">http://t.co/GCUpab0dnW</a> We might reach 100% funded today <a href="http://t.co/N8OMchfTlS">pic.twitter.com/N8OMchfTlS</a></p>

<p>YOU DID IT! Less than 18 hours after an initial push, a few cheeky tweets, LinkedIN posts and Google+ messages (and I wasn't alone) - remarkably the D8Rules DrupalFund project had achieved full funding. To be clear, this is one of several funding stages.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><p>Boom! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23D8Rules&amp;src=hash">#D8Rules</a> fully funded <a href="http://t.co/xBKKIHWDHQ">http://t.co/xBKKIHWDHQ</a> The Drupal community is amazing. <a href="http://t.co/Q4HayOkCsZ">pic.twitter.com/Q4HayOkCsZ</a></p>

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>With the enormous and passionate Drupal community behind you, it is possible to achieve amazing outcomes in a really short timeframe. However, no matter how compelling the story, you still need to work hard and promote your idea. As Dries recently blogged "<a href="http://buytaert.net/entrepreneurship-is-80-percent-sales-and-marketing">Entrepreneurship is 80% sales and marketing</a>". The same applies to Drupal funding initiatives.</p>
<p>Even more, if we all pull in the same direction we can make the impossible possible. If you hear of a worthy cause in Drupal, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Happy to help. The Drupal <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/node/18708">Social Media Request Form</a> is a good place to start. You can also find other great places to <a href="http://www.pauldjohnson.co.uk/drupal-news-podcasts-email-services-training-worth-knowing-about">promote your Drupal news here</a> such as The Weekly Drop and several podcasts. As techies we aren't all natural marketers, but if you tried a little you might be surprised at the positive outcomes. Never lose sight of the fact that as a Drupalist you have many friends, try and encourage others to become advocates of your idea. If they tell their friends you can reach a LOT of people.</p>
<h2>Meet the D8Rules funders</h2>
<p>To close, I would like to point towards the <a href="https://www.drupalfund.us/node/481/funders">#D8Rules funders page</a>. Meet the people who are helping to make Drupal 8 Rules possible.</p>
