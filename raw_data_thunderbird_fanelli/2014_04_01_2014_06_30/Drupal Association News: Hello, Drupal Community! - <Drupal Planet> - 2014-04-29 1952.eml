    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img alt="" class="left" src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/rachel-profile-pic.jpg" /> My name is Rachel Friesen and I’m the newest member of the Drupal Association. I’ve been hired on to a Sponsor Fulfillment position, which means I will be working closely with those of you who help the Association through sponsorships and business partnerships.</p>
<p>As part of my work with the Association, I’ll be ensuring that sponsors’ ads are placed, their booth assignments for trade shows are correct, that registration perks are all in order, and that they get the most out of their sponsorships. Previously, I have worked with small businesses, all the way up to large consulting firms, and knew that in a new position I wanted to work with an enthusiastic and engaged community.</p>
<p>I’m so excited to be on board, and can’t wait to get started. I’m impressed by the Association’s enthusiasm for the Project and for serving the community. I’m also continually excited by the passion, commitment, and dedication of the Drupal community to the Project and to each other.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy curling and kickball! I grew up in Indiana, but moved to Portland in my early twenties and fell in love with the city then. After a couple years spent with family back home, I’m thrilled to be back in Portland, and can’t wait to dive in to working with the Drupal community and the great people and organizations that have grown the platform from a small social conduit to a powerful force on the web.</p>
<p>Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have down in the comments. I’m looking forward to speaking with and working with many of you soon!</p>
