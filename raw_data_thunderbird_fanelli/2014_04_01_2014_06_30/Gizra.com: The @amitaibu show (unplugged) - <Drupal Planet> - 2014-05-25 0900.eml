    <p>Wait, what? Did you actually think I&#39;m going to be in a DrupalCon without giving a presentation?
Oh, the fact that my session was <em>not</em> selected made you think that. I see. I can understand how that could have caused the confusion.</p>

<p>So the thing is that I have a presentation titled &quot;The Gizra Way&quot; that I&#39;ve been giving for the past year all over Israel, and recently in DrupalCamp Spain. Reactions were pretty good.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>My prediction is that most watched <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DrupalcampEs&amp;src=hash">#DrupalcampEs</a> video will be <a href="https://twitter.com/amitaibu">@amitaibu</a> session as soon as it is available. Really inspiring!</p>&mdash; penyaskito (@penyaskito) <a href="https://twitter.com/penyaskito/statuses/467674213906931712">May 17, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>We are still looking for a place to do it. Maybe in a BoF room. Or in the staircase. Or a bar near the hotel.
And you know what? I&#39;m really excited about this idea. It feels like I&#39;m preparing for the unplugged version of my show. Anyway, we&#39;ll <a href="https://twitter.com/gizra_drupal">tweet</a> the time and location once we find the place.</p>
