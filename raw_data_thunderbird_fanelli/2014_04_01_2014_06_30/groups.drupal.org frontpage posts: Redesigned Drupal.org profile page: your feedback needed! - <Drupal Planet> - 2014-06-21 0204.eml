    <p>Hi everyone! We're in the process of redesigning the profile page on Drupal.org, and we need the community's feedback! You can find the issue at: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2281763" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/2281763">https://www.drupal.org/node/2281763</a>.</p>
<p>Specific feedback needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assuming that we're keeping the current theme, does the organization of information make sense on the page? </li>
<li>Is there any new information we should be collecting on profiles? Since this will require refactoring several of the data elements in profiles, we have a great opportunity to allow users to show/share more about themselves. </li>
<li>Are there any things you've been DYING to see on user profiles that you haven't seen yet? Now's a great opportunity to share them! </li>
</ol>
<p>Feedback will be collected until August 1st, and the layouts will be iterated over the next month and a half. Thanks for your feedback!</p>
