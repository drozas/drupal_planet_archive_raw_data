It will take place in a magnificent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portoro%C5%BE">costal town Portorož</a>, which is conveniently located in the northern part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea">Adriatic sea</a>.</p>
<p>Camp will happen on 17th and 18th May with extended sprints happening also on 19th and 20th. We already have some <a href="http://2014.drupalalpeadria.org/sessions">great session proposals</a> and new ones are coming in almost every day! Are you new to Drupal? No problems! We're preparing some very interesting beginner-level sessions and on-site trainings. For those who prefer to code we have some <a href="http://2014.drupalalpeadria.org/sprints">very interesting sprints to offer</a>! There will be Drupal 8 core and Drupal 8 media sprints going on. Are you interested in organizing another sprint? Do not hesitate to <a href="http://2014.drupalalpeadria.org/contact">contact us immediately</a>!</p>
<p>Early bird tickets are available only until 25th April. Don't miss your last chance to get them and start planning your travels well in advance. Portorož is <a href="http://2014.drupalalpeadria.org/sightseeing">very nice for families and children</a> so you should really consider bringing your significant others with you and maybe extending Drupal camp into a short spring vacation.</p>
