The vast majority of our partners have their own “secret sauce” in the form of knowledge, best practice, and process spanning the gamut of the digital experience: search engine optimization, marketing campaign analytics, mobile and responsive design, content and UX strategy, and much more. This value-add is captured at the time of delivery, but remains even more important to continuously monitor and improve the site experience. <a href="/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/insight" target="_blank">Acquia Insight</a> is a tool that partners can use today-- for the low price of free-- to deliver this value-add in real-time and feature their own services.</p>
