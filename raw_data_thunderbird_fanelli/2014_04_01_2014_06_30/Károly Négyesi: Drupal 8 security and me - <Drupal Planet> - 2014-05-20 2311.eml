    <p>Summary: if you are working on a core patch which smells like it might be security related please <a href="https://drupal.org/user/9446/contact">let me know</a> and I will review. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am working on  <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1825952">switching twig autoescape on</a>. Help is warmly appreciated, please <a href="https://drupal.org/user/9446/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><p>Long story short, as I have tried (and mostly succeeded) in vacating the core queue I found myself in a trap: while I can overlook what I perceive as architecture shortfalls in Drupal 8, as long as I remain within the Drupal ecosystem I can't in a good conscience overlook the security holes and I can't leave the Drupal ecosystem without seriously compromising my fiscal situation. So I am doing what I can to make sure Drupal 8 is secure and completely leave performance, developer experience and such problems to others. I am also trying to help a little with documentation as long as it's not controversial and documentation rarely is.</p>
