It starts off with a full day of <a href="https://2014.drupalcampcolorado.org/content/drupalcamp-colorado-trainings">trainings and workshops</a> on Friday, August 1st. Two days of sessions follow on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Aten is thrilled to be sponsoring this event financially and through people power. As this year's Camp project manager, I've enjoyed working with several of my Aten colleagues and many other members of the Colorado Drupal Community to bring this event together. Special callouts go to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/about/roxy-koranda">Roxy</a> for the amazing design</li>
<li><a href="/about/scott-reynen">Scott</a> for leading the development effort</li>
<li><a href="/about/ken-woodworth">Ken</a> for organizing and working on front-end development</li>
<li><a href="/about/jon-clark">Jon</a> for sponsorship wrangling</li>
<li><a href="/about/lydia-toupin">Lydia</a> our AWESOME Studio Manager for organizing the Saturday night party
</ul>

<p>That’s right, Aten is hosting the DrupalCamp Colorado party on Saturday night. We’ll have more details soon. What we can say now is that there will be delicious food and drinks with great networking opportunities!</p>

<p>The camp this year is <strong>FREE</strong> to all, but individual <a href="http://2014.drupalcampcolorado.org/register">donations</a> are being accepted. Any registration contributions beyond our budget target will be donated to 3 charities:</p>
