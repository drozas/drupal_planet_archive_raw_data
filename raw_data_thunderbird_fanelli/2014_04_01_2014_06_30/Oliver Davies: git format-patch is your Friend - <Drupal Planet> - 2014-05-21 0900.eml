<p>As an active contributor to the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> project, I spend a lot of time working with other peoplesâ€™ modules and themes, and occassionally have to fix a bug or add some new functionality.</p>

<p>In the Drupal community, we use a patch based workflow where any changes that I make get exported to a file detailing the differences. The patch file (*.patch) is attached to an item in an issue queue on Drupal.org, applied by the maintainer to their local copy of the code and reviewed, and hopefully committed.</p>
