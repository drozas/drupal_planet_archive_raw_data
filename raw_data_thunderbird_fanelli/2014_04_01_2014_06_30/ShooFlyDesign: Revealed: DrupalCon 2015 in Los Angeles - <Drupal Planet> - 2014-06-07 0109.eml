    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Every year there are two huge Drupal conferences: one in North America, the other somewhere else in the world. <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/">North America's was in Austin</a> this year, and just wrapped up. <a href="http://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/">The next one will be in Amsterdam</a> at the end of September.  It's a tradition at each con to announce the location of the next one, and next year's will be here in Los Angeles. Yay! I've been to many camps, but never to a con, so this gives me absolutely no way out of finally going.  I'm definitely looking forward to this.</p>

<p>I found out about this very shortly before Austin, and helped some of the fine folks in <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/la">LA's Drupal community</a> put together a video that played during the closing session in Austin, revealing our fair city as the next location.  I worked on the music for it, sourcing some material and playing a little bit of ukulele.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6ea6RRSU5o">Check it out!</a></p>
