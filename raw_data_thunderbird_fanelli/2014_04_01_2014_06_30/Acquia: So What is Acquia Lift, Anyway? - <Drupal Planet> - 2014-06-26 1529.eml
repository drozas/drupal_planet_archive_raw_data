          <div property="content:encoded" class="field-item even"><p>I’ve spent a disproportionate amount of my time over the last year thinking and talking about Personalization in Drupal (just ask my wife), and I’ve had the privilege of working with a brilliant group of people to help design and build a solution for it. Since we launched Lift in February, I’ve also given a large number of demos and discussed Lift in great detail with organizations large and small, learning ever more about what the needs are in the market, and stealing..err..borrowing ideas from them as I go along.</p>
<p>This post marks the first of a multi-part blog series where I hope to distill everything I know about Acquia Lift as a product, as well as personalization, testing and targeting more broadly as we implement these tools.</p>
