We are more than excited to get to Austin to greet old friends and meet many new ones. While we're (mostly) all there, we hope you'll join us for the June board meeting. We''l be in room 10B on the third floor of the Austin convention center at 11:45 am. Lunch will be served there, so no need to battle the lunch lines downstairs before you join us.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't join us in Austin, you can still <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8528915352182573314">join us remotely</a>, as per usual.Â </p>
<p><strong>What's on the agenda this time?</strong></p>
<ul><li>
		An abbreviated Operational Update from staff. We normally provide metrics and full narratives for all the areas of our work. Because this meeting is so early in the month, we are unable to provide those metrics. We'll catch you back up in July.</li>
	<li>
		Presentation of the 2013 Audit. All the news is back from our auditor and we are ready to share the findings with you.</li>
	<li>
		Updates from the Drupal.org Working Groups. They'll share what they've been focused on and what's coming up.</li>
</ul><p>All the materials for this meeting are available in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/association.drupal.org/?tab=oo#folders/0B8gZDNT4xrvZLUl2MFg0djNycXc">public board folder</a> for this meeting. Looking forward to your questions and ideas!</p>
