    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>I’m excited to announce that the Drupal Association Board of Directors has filled two open seats on the Board. Please welcome Mike Lamb of Pfizer and Rob Gill of NBC Universal. Mike and Rob fill board-appointed seats rather than the At-Large seats that are filled via community vote (by the way, stay tuned for communications about the next community vote for 2015 At-Large seats).   </p>
<p>We couldn’t be more thrilled about Mike and Rob joining the board. Because they both have extensive experience as end-users of Drupal, we believe they will provide valuable input from a perspective that currently isn’t fully realized on the board.</p>

			<td>
				<p>Mike, who lives in Wales, has been with Pfizer for the past ten years. He has a background in web development, business management, and project management, and currently is the Director of Marketing Technology Strategy.</p>

			<td>
				<p>Rob is based in the U.S. and is the Vice President of Media Products at NBCUniversal, Inc, where he advocates open source as a method of rapid content creation and delivery in a quickly shifting media landscape. Both Rob and Mike are well-versed in Drupal and have been great advocates for the project in their respective organizations.</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p>Both of the new board members will attend their first face-to-face board meeting at DrupalCon Austin. If you will be attending the event, please <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/drupal-association-public-board-meeting">stop by the board meeting on Wednesday </a><a href="http://austin2014.drupal.org/drupal-association-public-board-meeting">June 4 </a>and say hello.</p>
<p>We are excited about the addition of Mike and Rob. We’re looking forward to the next two years with them, and know they will be fantastic members of the Drupal Association Board of Directors.</p>
