<p>Our awesome design partner this year, CTI Digital, has been put through their paces producing all the design for both 2014 DrupalCons in Austin and Amsterdam.  While they have done a stellar job, we know this process has proved taxing on their resources, since there was so much cross-over between the deliverables for both cons.  Sorry, CTI!</p>
<p>Learning from this, we have selected two designers for 2015 / 2016, and will be staggering each firm’s workload.  Each designer will produce one Con in 2015 and a second in 2016.</p>
<h2>
	Now to the fun part! </h2>
<p>We were WOWed by all the talented designers who applied, and are so thankful for all the companies that participated. It was a difficult choice, but we have selected <a href="http://cheekymonkeymedia.ca/">Cheeky Monkey Media</a>, out of Canada to work on 2015 Los Angeles DrupalCon and <a href="http://adcisolutions.com/">ADCI Solutions</a>, out of Russia to work on the 2015 European DrupalCon (the location of which is yet to be announced…).</p>
<p>We are confident that all of the goodness of community, culture, and innovation will be captured in each of these designers work as we continue to evolve and grow the DrupalCons worldwide!</p>
<p>Congrats to Cheeky Monkey Media and ADCI Solutions! Welcome to the DrupalCon family.</p>
