    <div class="field field-node--body field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden" data-edit-id="node/42/body/und/rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="schema:text"><p>On May 2, 2014 the Drupal Core Gittip Team was somewhat quietly launched. There was a helpful quick round of questions on twitter and in IRC, and more details were added to the <a href="https://www.gittip.com/DrupalCoreGittipTeam/">Drupal Core Gittip Team profile page</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/DrupalCoreGT">@DrupalCoreGT twitter account</a>. This post is a follow-up with even more details. We hope this answers more questions people have, and continues the discussion.</p>

<p>We are just getting started, so some of this information will probably change as we gain experience and more feedback.</p>

<p>We recognize that the most significant contribution to Drupal has always been and will continue to be the unfunded voluntary contributions of the many. Our hope is that the Team can play a part in making Drupal core development sustainable.</p>

<p>Thanks, Cathy and Alex</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p>We are making the world better by working on Drupal Core.</p>

<p>Drupal Core contributors need consistent, reliable sponsorship without having to be experts in fundraising, and would-be sponsors need a central place to contribute that they can have confidence in. The <a href="https://www.gittip.com/DrupalCoreGittipTeam/">Drupal Core Gittip Team</a> hopes to be part of meeting these needs.</p>

<p>This team is run by Drupal Core mentor and contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/yesct">@YesCT</a> and Drupal Core committer <a href="https://twitter.com/alexpott">@alexpott</a>. Contact us to join the team. We are looking for people who reliably work on Drupal Core and want help meeting their funding goals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/teams/">Read more about how Gittip teams work</a>.</p>

<p>For a bit of history you can read my <a href="http://yesct.net/targeting">blog post on fundraising</a> or <a href="http://drupaleasy.com/podcast/2014/02/drupaleasy-podcast-123-its-got-berdir">listen to the DrupalEasy funding podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I apply to join the Drupal Core Gittip Team?</h2>
<p>Ping <a href="https://twitter.com/yesct">@YesCT</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/alexpott">@alexpott</a> on IRC or twitter. Tell us about your contribution, your current funding, and your funding goal (if you have one).</p>
<h2>I contribute to Drupal Core - do I qualify to join the Drupal Core Gittip Team?</h2>
<p>The team is for funding people who are reliably working on Drupal Core. 
If you are listed in <a href="http://bit.ly/MAINTAINERS">MAINTAINERS.txt</a> or have more than ten core commit mentions within the past six months, then you should be automatically eligible. If you do not meet those criteria but feel you have been contributing reliably to Drupal core, then give more detail about your contributions and the admins will review this. (If an admin rejects membership, an applicant can ask it to be put to all members for discussion and a ballot, with a simple majority needed.)</p>

<p>Over time, members of the Gittip team will be periodically reviewed. Team members who have stopped contributing to core for a significant period of time, or are suspected of abusing the criteria for membership (for example a shared Drupal.org/gittip account) may have their team membership revoked.</p>
<h2>How much money do members get?</h2>
<p>Gittip Teams are set up by Gittip such that each member chooses how much money they claim, starting at max US$1, which they are able to double each week, with new members getting priority. Who receives money and the amount each member receives is publicly available on the <a href="https://www.gittip.com/DrupalCoreGittipTeam/members/">members tab on Gittip</a>.</p>

<p>We have set some additional guidelines and will review these over time.</p>
<h2>What other agreement is there among Team members for deciding who gets how much money?</h2>
<p>If your company pays you for all of your time contributing to Drupal Core, please do not also ask to be funded through the Drupal Core Gittip Team. The Gittip team is a way for companies and individuals to support people who are contributing their own time, without compensation, to Drupal Core development.</p>

<h3>Preliminary claim guidelines:</h3>
<ul><li>(After May 8, 2014) Members when they join are asked to set their claim to US$1/week, when they meet the criteria for reliable Drupal Core work.</li>
<li>It is ok to be a member of the group and claim less than US$1.</li>
<li>An initial goal is for members, who have some of their hours working on Core not funded, and want to have it funded, to get at least one hour a week of funds.</li>
<li>Until we have enough weekly contributions coming in to fund more than one hour for members (who want it, and meet the criteria), please do not set your claim higher than max (US$64, $total_funds/$number_people_wanting_funds).</li>
<li>When we have enough money to give everyone who wants (and meets the criteria), we will announce letting people claim up to 4 hours a week.</li>
<li>Members wanting to claim more than US$256 or 4 hours a week, should publish a summary (short: 140 characters) of what they worked on and share it with the team each week. People can up their claims, maxing out at 8 hours a week.</li></ul><h2>When should a member reduce their claims?</h2>
<ul><li>Vacation? If the vacation is less than 2 weeks (per 20 weeks) there is no need to reduce your claim.</li>
<li>Members should reduce their claim when they have gone more than 2 weeks with their work funded from some other source.</li>
<li>Partial reducing is encouraged, if for example they picked up partial funding from other places, but still have some work unfunded.</li></ul><h2>Who are the admins and how are they selected?</h2>
<p>Currently YesCT and alexpott can add members via the <a href="https://twitter.com/DrupalCoreGT">twitter account</a>. Admins are selected by â€¦ them volunteering to take on admin responsibilities, and being a member of the group for at least 7 weeks. New admins will be appointed by the current/outgoing admins, when an open admin slot is available.</p>
<h2>Who are you to try and tackle the funding situation?</h2>
<p>We are Drupal Core contributors that have tried to fund our work, have talked with others who have attempted to get their work funded, and are trying to move forward with something we think has potential.</p>
<h2>What Drupal Core work does this fund?</h2>
<p>It funds people who meet the criteria. On receipt of funds people are free to do what they want. This is tip - the work is already done.</p>
<h2>Why a Gittip Team?</h2>
<ul><li>Gittip because: Gittip can maximise fundraising efforts using a fundraising platform well known to the community - over 500 Drupal people are already there.</li>
<li>A team because: donors will not have to move their sponsorship as the funding needs change for the people who work on Drupal Core. And people who work on Drupal Core do not have to do new fundraising as their sponsors change.</li>
<li>We hope the team provides a central, consistent, and trusted space to raise funds for Core development.</li>
<li>We hope through the community controlled membership the funds are targeted in the best way possible, to those that deserve and need it.</li>
<li>Core development is driven primarily by individuals working across a large number of different patches/subsystems, as opposed to specific fixed-scope projects. Funds with no specific development targets attached support this.</li>
<li>Core is bigger and more complex than ever. This is one solution to help individuals continue to contribute time, especially if they are not supported by the company they work for.</li>
<li>There are individuals and companies who can not donate development time to core this provides a way for them support core development.</li></ul><h2>Why not the Drupal Association?</h2>
<p>Current charter says the DA must not direct Core. This is felt by many to preclude the Drupal Association from fundraising for core development. The Drupal Core Gittip Team plans to work with the Drupal Association on the issue of Core sustainability and funding.</p>
<h2>What is your funding goal?</h2>
<p>US$5000 per week.</p>
<h2>Why so much?</h2>
<p>Depending on cost of living assumptions, that is the equivalent of 2 full time people.</p>
<h2>Why so little?</h2>
<p>Yeah, it will take a lot more than that to make Drupal Core funding more sustainable, but it is a start.</p></div></div></div><div  class="field field-node--field-tags field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden clearfix" data-edit-id="node/42/field_tags/und/rss"><ul class="links"><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-0"><a href="/taxonomy/term/3" property="schema:about">funding</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-1"><a href="/planet" property="schema:about">Planet</a></li></ul></div><div class="field field-node--comment field-name-comment field-type-comment field-label-hidden" data-edit-id="node/42/comment/und/rss"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" rel="schema:comment"><section id="comments" class="comment-wrapper">

Note, since members start at US$1, and can only double every week, it would take 7 weeks before anyone could get to US$64. This gives us more time to think through the claim agreement.

<p>Note, we do not, as yet, have enough money to worry about the following, but this documents some ideas.</p></div></div></div>
