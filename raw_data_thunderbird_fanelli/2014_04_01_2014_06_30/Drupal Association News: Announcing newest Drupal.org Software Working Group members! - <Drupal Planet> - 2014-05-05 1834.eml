<p>Last summer, we <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/node/18033">created</a> three Drupal.org working groups: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2001478">one for content</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2001476">one for software</a>, and <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2001480">one for infrastructure</a>. Since then, Working Group members have put countless hours of time and energy into making Drupal.org the best it can be! Now that we’re winding to the end of our first year with the working groups, we’d like to announce small changes in membership. We have two new members joining the Drupal.org Software Working Group!</p>
<p>Drupal gurus Cathy Theys (<a href="https://drupal.org/user/258568">YesCT</a>) and David Hernandez (<a href="https://drupal.org/user/274559">davidhernandez</a>) will be bringing a fantastic array of skills and experience to the DSWG. David has great perspective and a background that will help encourage strategic-level thinking within  the Working Group; and, as many of us know firsthand, Cathy has tons of experience coordinating volunteers and directing volunteer energy on Drupal.org. Both Cathy and David are trusted members of the Drupal community, and will help us carry out our decisions and make Drupal.org better than ever.</p>
<p>The seats that Cathy and David are filling were recently vacated by Kim Pepper (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/370574">kim.pepper</a>) and Melissa Anderson (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/33570">eliza411</a>), who decided to step down and focus on other projects. We’d like to thank both of them for their time and effort, their participation in the Working Group all these months was invaluable. Though we’re sad to see Kim and Melissa go, we’re thrilled to welcome David and Cathy on board. Welcome to the Drupal.org Software Working Group!</p>
