    <p>The fastest way to teach your users how to use your web application got even faster. We have integrated the great Rules module, so you can easily define logic within your Drupal installation when to launch specific tutorials.</p>
<p>Imagine you have built a website for your client and now you need to train the editors how to work with content. You can use Inline Manual for this already, instead of doing workshops or screencasts, however, what if there are new employees/editors coming in afterwards? How would you get them quickly learn the system?</p>  </div>
