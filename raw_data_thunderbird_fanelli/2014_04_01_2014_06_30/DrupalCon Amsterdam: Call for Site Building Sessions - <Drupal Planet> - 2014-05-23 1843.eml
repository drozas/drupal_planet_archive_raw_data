Share your Drupal 8 knowledge with the world at DrupalCon Amsterdam: the Site Building Track Team is calling for sessions, and we want YOU to help us out. </p>
<p>We are looking for proposals of sessions focused on Drupal 8. Our goal is to get everybody updated on the current status of Contrib Module 8 Status. There will even be a special two hour session which will allow Drupal 8 Module Maintainers to give a short update about the status of their modules.</p>
<p>If you're interested in giving a 12 minute session about your module, <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/user/2583/contact" target="_blank">talk to Schnitzel</a> or post it as a comment here.</p>
<p>As we all know, DrupalCon is about more than just Drupal 8, so let’s not forget Drupal 7 and 6! With Site Building we can achieve and build great sites without needing to code-- and since there are a lot of ways to reach a goal, let’s share the knowledge, and teach each other how to achieve great things. Are you using a module in really cool ways? With real life examples? Propose a session!</p>
<p>A special focus will also be set on layout modules. There are a lot of modules which allow us to position content on a Drupal Page. Let’s compare and analyze them, so everyone will know what each module is for and can decide for what to use them. Are you proficient with a layout module? We love to hear about it!</p>
