          <div class="field-item" property="schema:text"><p>In the first week of March of 2014, Google announced Google Summer of Code and I started to search for a project that suits my skill and I found one with the title “An Example iOS application that connects to Drupal 8 via REST web services”. </p>

<p>And that day I joined Drupal as a community member. As of now we all are so excited about Drupal 8. I am working on this project and I will try to build an example app that runs on iOS 7.1 and can view, create, update and delete content from an iOS device. If time permits I will try to add more functionalities to the app.</p>

<p>I have got good mentors from the Drupal community Jeff Linwood (jefflinwood) and Jingsheng Wang (skyred) for this project. As a part of this project I have created a simple site with Drupal 8 that has few pages with 3 simple fields and our aim is to manipulate these pages with the iOS app. I have deployed Drupal 8 on OpenStack from RedHat. This is the URL for my site <a href="http://tntfoss-vivekvpandya.rhcloud.com">http://tntfoss-vivekvpandya.rhcloud.com</a>.</p>

<p>REST services for Drupal 8 are new, so I will try and provide good examples that can describes how to use it. </p>

<p>In Drupal 8 alpha 11 some problems with REST are resolved for example no more “entity” word should required to access REST service i.e instead of “entity/node/1” you can now access it with “node/1” (more RESTful way) and I appreciate guys working behind it. </p>

<p>On the iOS side, I am using NSURLSession to connect my app to the site. This set of classes are introduced by Apple in 2013 with iOS 7. REST services on Drupal 8 can serialize data in JSON, XML or HAL_JSON formate and I have used this JSON object to display content from the site. I have upload my code on <a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a> so other interested community member can review it and help me to make this more useful.
