The default links row includes one reading "Log in to post comments" but this blog doesn't allow anybody else to register for an account, and in any case comments are handled by Disqus rather than Drupal's commenting system.  The link didn't need to be there at all, and the more I looked at the links row the more useless it looked.</p><br/><script type="text/javascript"><!--
