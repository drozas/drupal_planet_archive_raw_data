Here, I learn the inside story on one of the first Drupal 8 sites online, <a href="http://www.sensiolabs.co.uk/">www.sensiolabs.co.uk</a>, what their goals were, how they built it and have kept it running since May 2013, and how Drupal 8 will change the way they design applications for clients going forward.</p>
