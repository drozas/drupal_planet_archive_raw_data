    <p>Greetings from your friendly neighbourhood Drupal.org Software Working Group!</p>
<p><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2261945" title="https://drupal.org/node/2261945">https://drupal.org/node/2261945</a> has a proposal + mockups on a new way to handle feature requests for Drupal.org in order to help both the Drupal.org Software Working Group and other working groups prioritize the feature roadmap for Drupal.org. Since this tool will become the method through which the Drupal community (in the widest sense of the word) makes known their Drupal.org needs/wants/desires, we'd love to hear your comments and feedback on the proposal.</p>
<p>Community feedback period is open until May 18th, as we're hoping to have an initial version of this tool ready by Austin.</p>
