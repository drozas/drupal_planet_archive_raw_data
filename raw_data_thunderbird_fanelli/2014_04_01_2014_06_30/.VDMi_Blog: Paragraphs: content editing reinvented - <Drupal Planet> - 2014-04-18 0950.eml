Those people can quite mess up your responsive layout with their way too big tables, inline images and text marked up with Word. That&#039;s why we invented Paragraphs, less to mess up, but still the flexibility of WYSIWYG.</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Let's face it, the web has evolved. But what about content editors? Dit they evolve with the web?</p><p>Most of them still like to paste everything they can find into a big WYSIWYG texarea. That's not a viable option when you want to build responsive website. It gets even hard when you want to use cool technologies like <a href="https://github.com/teleject/hisrc" target="_blank">responsive images</a>. Wouldn't it be awesome if you had all those pictures in image fields, or maybe even better, in <a href="https://drupal.org/project/scald" target="_blank">Scald</a>? Behold: <a href="https://drupal.org/project/paragraphs" target="_blank">Paragraphs</a>!</p><p>We developed Paragraphs to be a full blown replacement of the default body field. It's comparable with Inline Entity Form, except that you can use different types of bundles in the same field. It also comes with content editing features like having your paragraphs collapsed by default. More features are on the way!</p><p>Some examples of Paragraph Bundles that we have created in the past:</p><ul><li>Slideshow - A simple slideshow in your content:<br />- Create a slideshow Paragraph bundle.<br />- Add a multi-value image field.<br />- Use a slideshow formatter.</li><li>Youtube embed - A Youtube embed between your text blocks:<br />- Create a Youtube Paragraph bundle.<br />- Add a simple <a href="http://drupal.org/project/emfield">embed</a> field.Â <br />- Tweak the formatter settings to fit your needs.</li><li>Customer Quote - Add a personal quote/review from your customer in your content:<br />- Add a author, text and optional email field.<br />- Theme it to your style, with bundles-specific templates.</li></ul><p>The bundles above are use-case-specific, we often start with the following bundles:</p><ul><li>Text: a simple WYSIWYG textfield with the basis buttons enabled, like bold and italic.</li><li>Text Left, Image Right: same as above, but with an image on the right of the text.</li><li>Text Right, Image Left: same as above, but with the image on the left.</li><li>Fullwidth image: an image that takes the full width of the content.</li></ul><p>All paragraph bundles have their own display settings and view modes, just like nodes! Because of that, every paragraph item also has it's own theme suggestion.</p><p>Because of the seperation of content, it's great for a responsive site. For example: Just add a wrapper around your slider paragraphs that hides the slider on mobile, or makes it smaller on tablets.</p><p>Excited already? <a href="http://simplytest.me/project/paragraphs" target="_blank">Try it out!</a><br />Want to know more? <a href="https://drupal.org/project/paragraphs">Check the project page.</a></p><p>Note: Paragraphs is also useful if you want to build a <a href="http://www.vdmi.nl/diensten/drupal/wat-kost-een-drupal-website">Drupal site</a> with Parallax scrolling. More on that later!</p></div></div></div>
