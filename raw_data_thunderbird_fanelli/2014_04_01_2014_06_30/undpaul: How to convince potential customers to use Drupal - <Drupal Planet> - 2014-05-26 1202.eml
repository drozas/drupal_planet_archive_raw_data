And there are many clients looking for services like ours. Some clients know they want Drupal. Others still have to be convinced. Especially here in Germany, we have to compete against <a href="http://typo3.org/">TYPO3</a>, because it's an established content management system for the enterprise. We believe Drupal is similar or superior to what TYPO3 and others can accomplish, but it's not easy to convince others about it.</div>
<div>In order to win a client, you might list some advantages of Drupal and show some of the sites you've built with the system. However, you can't show the backends of most sites you've built for clients and a plain install of Drupal is not very convincing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A demo system is a great way to show the potential of Drupal, but creating your own is time-consuming to build and maintain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gladly, Acquia provides a free demo distribution called <a href="https://drupal.org/project/df">Demo Framework</a>. The demo is a personalized, multilingual platform with modern responsive capabilities including previews for different devices. With its beautiful interface and sample commerce and multimedia integration, it's perfect to show just what our favorite content management framework Drupal is capable of.</div>
