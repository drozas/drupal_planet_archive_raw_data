<p>This is the Drupal community&#8217;s biggest conference for all things Drupal and it&#8217;s a great chance for you to meet all the Larks who are in&nbsp;attendance. </p>
<p>To set up a meeting with us, <a href="/contact">send us a message</a> or mention @<a href="https://twitter.com/LarksLA">LarksLA</a> on Twitter. We&#8217;d love to talk with you about <a href="http://droplabs.net">Droplabs</a>, the Drupal incubator we co-founded in Los Angeles in 2011, how it&#8217;s become the <a href="http://droplabs.net/news/droplabs-recognized-as-worlds-top-drupal-location">Top Drupal Location</a> in the world, and how to start a Droplabs in your&nbsp;city.</p>
<p><img src="/sites/all/files/partners/droplabs-180x62.jpeg" align="left" height="62" width="180" alt="Droplabs" hspace="5" vspace="5" /> If you&#8217;re in the Los Angeles area and aren&#8217;t going to DrupalCon, you&#8217;re welcome to join Lee Vodra, one of the co-founders of both Exaltation of Larks and Droplabs, for a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/425898">Droplabs Open House</a> on Thursday, June&nbsp;5th. </p>
<p>Droplabs will be announcing its <a href="http://droplabs.net/academy">Droplabs Academy</a> and tuning in to the live stream of the <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/live">DrupalCon Austin Closing Session</a>. Drop by and meet some of the Larks who are in Southern California and say farewell to DrupalCon Austin and &#8220;hello!&#8221; to DrupalCon Amsterdam, DrupalCon Bogota, and the surprise location of DrupalCon North America&nbsp;2015.</p>
