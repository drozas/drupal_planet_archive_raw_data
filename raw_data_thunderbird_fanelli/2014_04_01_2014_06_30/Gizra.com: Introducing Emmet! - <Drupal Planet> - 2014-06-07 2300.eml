<p>Emmet is a great tool that can enhance your productivity and save you a lot of time when coding or prototyping.<br>
Some of you may know it as &quot;Zen coding&quot; and for quite some time (Since 2012) it’s known as <a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a>.</p>

<p>Emmet is a plugin for a text editor which greatly improves html and css workflow.<br>
The idea behind it is to instantly expand a simple abbreviation (shortened form of a word or phrase) into complex code snippet.<br>
Emmet uses these abbreviations to parse them in runtime and transform them into structured code block: HTML, CSS, XML or any other structured markup.</p>
