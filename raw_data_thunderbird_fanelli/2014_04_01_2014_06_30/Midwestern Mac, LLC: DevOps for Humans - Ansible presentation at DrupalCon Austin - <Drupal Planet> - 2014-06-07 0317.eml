I kicked things off by walking around the downtown area, then taking the intensive Acquia Drupal Developer Certification exam. Once the conference started, I attended a few sessions, met a few awesome Drupalists, and learned a lot. On the last day of the 'Con (the last session, in fact), I presented <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/devops-humans-ansible-drupal-deployment-victory">DevOps for Humans: Ansible for Drupal Deployment Victory!</a>.</p>
<p>I think the presentation went well, and I heard some great questions at the end which really contributed to the discussion of Ansible and Drupal deployments in general. It was a great way to finish up the official DrupalCon sessions, though it meant I was revising slides for the hundredth time during the rest of the week, instead of relaxing and enjoying DrupalCon!</p>
<p>Before I post a video and slides from the session, I wanted to highlight some resources for anyone who attended (or didn't attend) DrupalCon Austin:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/412138">Extended sprints are still going on</a>â€”join up and help make Drupal better!</li>
<li>All the session videos are available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrupalAssociation">Drupal Association's YouTube Channel</a>. The videos are also embedded in each session's page on the Austin 2014 website. <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/sessions">Here's a list of all the sessions</a>.</li>
<li>Check out future DrupalCon info: <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014</a>, <a href="http://bogota2015.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Latin America 2015</a>, and <a href="https://losangeles2015.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015</a>.</li>
<li>If you attended the Palantir-sponsored Trivia Night, <a href="http://cafuego.net/2014/06/07/drupalcon-austin-drupal-trivia-scores">here are all the teams' final scores</a> (my table got 9th, with 3 DrupalCon first-timers!).</li>
