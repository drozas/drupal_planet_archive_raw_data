<p>Last Saturday afternoon, we were&nbsp;very fortunate to have&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/UN_CITO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atefeh Riazi</a>, UN CITO and Assistant Secretary General (ASG),&nbsp;deliver a keynote presentation to the 500+ Drupalists in attendance.</p>

<p>Salem Avan delivered the introduction&nbsp;to the keynote, and spoke about "<em>we the people</em>"&nbsp;and our&nbsp;inherited collective responsibility to help advance the UN's goals of furthering&nbsp;peace and security, international development, and human rights.</p>

<p>Ms. Riazi then delivered a riveting keynote that was a call to action for the Drupal community to help use technology to better the world. She emphasized the&nbsp;importance of leveraging innovation, collaboration and partnerships in order to solve the&nbsp;global challenges we face, and to respond&nbsp;to this call to action&nbsp;in a coordinated manner through partnerships that bring all of our best resources to bear.</p>

<p>Her exciting keynote address was followed-up with a stirring&nbsp;panel on &nbsp;Women &amp;&nbsp;Technology Leadership, that featured Mr. Riazi,&nbsp;<a href="https://association.drupal.org/about/staff" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holly Ross</a>&nbsp;(Executive Director or the Drupal Association), and&nbsp;<a href="http://webchick.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Angie Byron</a>&nbsp;(webchick). The panelist explored the pivotal importance&nbsp;of furthering female leadership is technology circles, and particularly the Drupal community.&nbsp;</p>
