<p>If you haven't used them before, tokens are essentially text placeholders - they can be static text, variables, field values, whatever you want really.</p>

<p>The Token API is now part of Drupal 7 core and as it turns out, using it to create your own tokens is super easy - you just need a couple of hooks.</p>

<p>The first hook, <span class="code">hook_token_info()</span>, is used to declare any custom tokens.</p></div></div></div>
