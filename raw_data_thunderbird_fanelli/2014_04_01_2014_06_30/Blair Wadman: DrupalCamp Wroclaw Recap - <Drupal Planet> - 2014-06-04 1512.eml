    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>When <a href="http://codewriters.co.uk">Marcin Padjdzik</a> suggested that we fly to Poland to give a talk at a DrupalCamp, I jumped at the chance. He later mentioned how surprised he was not to have to convince me! Especially considering neither of us had spoken at a conference before. The logic was simple: flying to a place where we knew that the audience would be strangers would make our first talk a whole lot easier. Luckily that theory proved to be correct!</p>
<p>I had a great time in Wroclaw. It is a lovely town and very scenic and the people seemed really friendly and relaxed. I spent every evening socialising with locals who were very welcoming. It was great to to spend the evenings that way rather than eating out at touristy restaurants.</p>
<p>Thanks go to the organisers for setting up and running this camp. The Drupal community is fairly small in Poland, so hats off to them for making this a success. They have been trying to attract English speakers to make it altogether more of an international affair. I think that is a great move and I can see it increasing in popularity over the next few years.</p>
<p>Keep reading to find out more about the camp...</p>
