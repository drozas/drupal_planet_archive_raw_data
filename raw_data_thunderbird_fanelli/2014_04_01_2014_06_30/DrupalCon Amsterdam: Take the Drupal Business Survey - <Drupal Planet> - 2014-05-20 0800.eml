<p>I <a href="http://wunderroot.co.uk/blog/drupalcon-europe-business-track-theme-ideas">blogged recently</a> about my initial thinking on the theme of the business track at DrupalCon Amsterdam this year.</p>
<p>Janne Kalliola, my co-chair and I decided to conduct a series of surveys to identify the strengths and weaknesses of businesses providing Drupal related services. From the findings we can then provide guidance to those proposing sessions for the conference in Amsterdam later this year.</p>
<p>We're launching 3 surveys â€” one for clients of Drupal businesses, one for the leaders of the businesses, and one for the staff of the businesses.</p>
<p>We'd really appreciate you filling in the survey that relates to you, and letting others know about this blog post so they can choose the survey that relates to them:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://wunder.webform.com/form/12036">Client Survey</a>
</li><li><a href="http://wunder.webform.com/form/12041">Staff Survey</a>
</li><li><a href="http://wunder.webform.com/form/12040">Owners/managers Survey</a>
</li></ul><p>The results are anonymous, and aggregated data will be published. Act quickly, the surveys close on the 28th of May. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about the survey you can contact me at <a href="mailto:steve.parks@wunderroot.co.uk">steve.parks@wunderroot.co.uk</a>.</p>
