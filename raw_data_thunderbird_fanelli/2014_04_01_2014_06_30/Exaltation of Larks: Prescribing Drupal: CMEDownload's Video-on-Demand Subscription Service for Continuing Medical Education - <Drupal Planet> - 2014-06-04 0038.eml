This video on demand (<span class="caps">VOD</span>) service contains thousands of lectures and hundreds of hours of continuing medical&nbsp;education.</p>
<p>The service is a good example of Drupal being used to power a <span class="caps">MOOC</span>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">massive open online course</a>: it combines digital-age distance learning with unlimited participation and open access to educational materials. CMEDownload has since been joined by other <span class="caps">MOOC</span> services using Drupal, including <a href="http://www.edx.org">edX.org</a>.</p>
<p>Attending conferences can be tricky for busy medical professionals. CMEDownload partners with top-level national and international medical conferences so that physicians can view lectures without leaving their homes, jobs, or families. Customers who sign up for an all-access pass can stream or download any of the thousands of videos and also earn certificates in continuing medical education through watching these&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>Exaltation of Larks has been working with CMEDownload since 2012. What started as a standard site audit &#8212; with a focus on improving website performance and fixing security issues &#8212; turned into a major refactoring project and infrastructure overhaul. With the results from our initial site audit, we have steadily improved the website in almost every&nbsp;way. </p>
<p>To this day, Exaltation of Larks continues to maintain and support the CMEDownload website. We are a fully-integrated, full-service design and engineering firm, and in the case of CMEDownload we have provided development, maintenance and support, infrastructure consulting and managed hosting&nbsp;services.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">IDENTIFYING</span> <span class="caps">CMEDOWNLOAD</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;<span class="caps">NEEDS</span></h3>
<p>Sujal Mandavia, CMEDownload&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO</span>, is a sharp businessperson with a great product. He wanted to improve CMEDownload&#8217;s security and performance and he needed a sleeker, faster-moving way to present and organize the service&#8217;s video media, as well as improve the user experience of the customer-facing&nbsp;features.</p>
<p>As someone with development experience himself, Sujal knew he needed to find a team that was familiar with site architecture for media-heavy sites, and who understood how to organize, catalog, and serve up large amounts of video media. Sujal searched extensively for the right team to handle the upgrades he&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The Larks&#8217; consistency was a plus,&#8221; Sujal says. &#8220;So was their level of experience.&#8221; Both companies have offices in Los Angeles &#8212; CMEDownload is an <span class="caps">LA</span> startup and Exaltation of Larks has a Los Angeles-based team &#8212; which made working together an easy&nbsp;decision.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">OUR</span> <span class="caps">PROGNOSIS</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">SOLUTION</span></h3>
<p><strong>Code Audit and Refactoring</strong><br />
We began with a full infrastructure audit. This included a review of CMEDownload&#8217;s web hosting, which at the time of our audit was on a dedicated Xserve server. This server was occasionally crashing and we took emergency measures to improve data integrity in the event that the MySQL database server crashed. At the same time, our implementations significantly improved the database&nbsp;performance. </p>
<p>Understanding the way the original CMEDownload website was constructed required high technical expertise. Through our audit, we learned we would need to untangle some of the previous development work. We refactored large parts of the codebase to use high quality third-party modules that are available on Drupal.org to provide the same functionality, while performing a code audit of the 17 custom modules installed. (The previous vendor had developed significant parts of the Drupal codebase from scratch and in many cases had reinvented the&nbsp;wheel.) </p>
<p><strong>Managed Hosting </strong><br />
CMEDownload is now hosted on Amazon Web Services (<span class="caps">AWS</span>). We&#8217;ve utilized <span class="caps">AWS</span> extensively to reduce CMEDownload&#8217;s web hosting costs by almost 50%. These changes include refactoring and optimization of the codebase and database, which have lowered both web hosting fees and ongoing maintenance&nbsp;costs. </p>
<p>We provide long-term support and maintenance services for CMEDownload. This includes ticket-based support, ongoing bug fixes, and working directly with CMEDownload’s staff. Through our support system, we provide CMEDownload with services for all of their hosting and infrastructure&nbsp;needs. </p>
<p><strong>Performance and Scalability</strong><br />
We improved CMEDownload&#8217;s page load speeds through extensive database tuning and performed significant database maintenance tasks, including automated integrity checks and optimization of the database&nbsp;tables. </p>
<p>Modules we installed and configured included <a href="https://drupal.org/project/varnish">Varnish</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/project/expires">Expires</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/purge">Purge</a>, and we added <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> caching that was missing for nearly all the blocks and pages, including video queues, playlists, completed quizzes,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>We also implemented the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/cdn"><span class="caps">CDN</span></a> module for Drupal in order to use a content delivery network. With the <span class="caps">CDN</span>, CMEDownload is able to deliver the files in its enormous video library much more quickly and efficiently to its&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p><strong>Security Improvements</strong><br />
One of the first things we worked on was improving security, fixing potential information disclosure vulnerabilities. Many pages and custom lists of information displayed by <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> did not check for access control, which we promptly&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>As is standard with e-commerce sites we work on, we performed an e-commerce audit to ensure that customer data was protected. This was also one of the first projects where we enforced <span class="caps">HSTS</span>, or <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Strict Transport Security, a security implementation created in&nbsp;2012. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span><span class="caps">HSTS</span> is a powerful and relatively little-used method for increasing security and even improving usability by preventing mixed content warnings. <a href="/articles/using-hsts-for-better-security-and-a-better-developer-experience">We recommend using <span class="caps">HSTS</span> on all our projects that use <span class="caps">SSL</span></a>,&#8221; says Christefano Reyes, of Exaltation of Larks. &#8220;It’s been part of our standard security package for a while and we would love to see more websites using&nbsp;it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Subscription Issues</strong><br />
Customers are presented with an interface similar to Netflix: members have a queue to which they add videos they want to save for later viewing. We added functionality that allowed members to reorder their queue and delete videos from it. CMEDownload also uses the Drupal <a href="https://drupal.org/project/itunes">iTunes</a> module to expose users&#8217; playlists in&nbsp;iTunes.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://www.larks.la/articles/prescription-for-drupal-cmedownload-video-on-demand-subscription-service-for-continuing-medical-education"><img src="https://www.larks.la/sites/all/files/clients/cme-queue-450x304.png" width="450" height="304" hspace="5" alt="CMEDownload queue" align="center" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We fine-tuned custom modules that determined how a lecture or course was labeled and displayed to subscribers, and who had permission to view what content. We also worked on streamlining a method for offering discount codes. Many lectures and courses have attached quizzes, to test subscribers on the material before they can gain a certificate of completion. We worked on CMEDownload&#8217;s custom modules to simplify the process of displaying these quizzes to&nbsp;viewers.</p>
<p>CMEDownload also keeps track of who has watched which videos, and issues the corresponding continuing education credits and certifications. CMEDownload uses custom code and scripts to calculate these credits and display them. These proprietary methods enable CMEDownload to track the views of individual&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>Exaltation of Larks is an <a href="http://www.authorize.net">Authorize.Net</a> development partner and we implemented their service with Drupal to better manage CMEDownload&#8217;s subscription&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Another customer-facing change we implemented was a switch from FlowPlayer to JWPlayer for streaming video. We chose <a href=&#8221;https://drupal.org/project/jwplayer>JWPlayer</a> because support for JWPlayer is very good and the player does most of the work: it can play <span class="caps">HTML</span> and Flash files in one instance, whereas with FlowPlayer it&#8217;s necessary to switch between two types to play <span class="caps">HTML</span> or Flash. CMEDownload and their customers are happy with the&nbsp;results.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">GIVING</span> <span class="caps">CMEDOWNLOAD</span> A <span class="caps">CLEAN</span> <span class="caps">BILL</span> <span class="caps">OF</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">HEALTH</span></h3>
<p>Our customer is very satisfied. Sujal&#8217;s only complaint was that he wished Exaltation of Larks had been on the project from day one. &#8220;I think companies like Larks have made it easier for folks to access the power and community of open source without being experts themselves,&#8221; Sujal&nbsp;says. </p>
<p>Sujal believes the Los Angeles startup scene has changed for the better in recent years. He recognized the need for a <span class="caps">CME</span> product and he filled that need, but the startup community was smaller and technical resources were harder to find at the time CMEDownload was founded. Open source software was available but only easily utilized by developers and hardcore&nbsp;aficionados. </p>
<p>Here at Exaltation of Larks, we&#8217;re extremely happy to have helped CMEDownload with their success. We are currently working with CMEDownload on upgrading from Drupal 6 to 7, which will make feature development considerably faster and further reduce support and maintenance&nbsp;costs.</p>
