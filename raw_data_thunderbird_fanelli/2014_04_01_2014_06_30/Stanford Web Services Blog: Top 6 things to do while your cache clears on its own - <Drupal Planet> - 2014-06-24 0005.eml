But they DO mean that your changes don't appear right away.</p>
<h2>Where are my changes?</h2>
<p>One of the things we here at Stanford Web Services get emailed about most frequently is, "Why did my changes disappear when I logged out?" The answer is that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache" rel="nofollow">site caches</a> haven't yet been updated, but they will if we wait a little bit (sometimes a few hours or so).</p></div></div></div>
