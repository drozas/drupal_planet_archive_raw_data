<p>If you came this far you probably liked this video just as much as I did :). You should really consider coming to Portorož in May to attend DC Alpe-Adria. We will have 2 days of great sessions, BoFs and sprints + 2 more day of extended sprints where we're going to focus on D8 and making it rock!</p>
<p>Portorož is also a great destination for children and families so you could bring your significant others and/or families with you and extend Drupal camp into an unforgettable vacation.</p>
<p>Interested? Of course you are! Find out more at <a href="http://drupalalpeadria.org">drupalalpeadria.org</a>.</p>
