The first step of the plan was the Drupal.org user research, which was <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/tvn/drupal.org-user-research-results-user-personas">recently finished</a>. Today we’d like to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the content strategy for Drupal.org, next step of our redesign project.</p>
<p>We’d like to develop the strategy, which will guide ongoing content development work performed by Drupal Association staff and the Drupal community, and inform our ongoing branding and design efforts. </p>
<p>If you or your company is interested in potentially performing the content strategy work, please see the dates and instructions in the RFP document for more detail. Also, if you know of a person or company who would be awesome for this project, please encourage them to participate. Thank you! </p>
