    <p>Want to get started with Drupal 8 coding, but not sure where to begin?</p>
<p>Fear not! That&#8217;s exactly how I felt before I jumped down the rabbit hole by attending my <a title="Forum One Enters the Sprints!" href="http://forumone.com/insights/forum-one-enters-the-sprints/">first Drupal 8 code sprint</a>, organized by the Forum One team earlier this month. Others there seemed to be in the same place I was in – which is to say that what we anticipated to be a quick installation actually turned into a lot of time spent that I&#8217;d have rather spent contributing!</p>
<p>To spare the next person from this experience I have created a friendly slideshow to guide you through the setup and installation process of getting Drupal 8 up-and-running locally.</p>
<p>Enjoy! And if you have any suggestions for enhancements, please leave them in the comments below <img src="http://forumone.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
