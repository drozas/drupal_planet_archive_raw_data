Arrange your travel and hotel to take advantage of the extended sprints before DrupalCon on 27-28 September, the big sprint day on Friday, 3 October, and the extended sprints after DrupalCon on 4-5 October. </p>
<h3>Stay for the sprints on Friday</h3>
<p>Every DrupalCon, we cap off the week with a full day of Drupal sprints. DrupalCon Amsterdam's sprint day is Friday, 3 October, starting at 9:00 and going until 18:00. You will not want to leave early and miss any of it. So, book your departure very very late Friday, or even better, Saturday or Sunday! </p>
<p>Whether you are a site builder, designer, programmer, themer, technical writer, project manager, or usability specialist, if you have Drupal experience, this is your chance to contribute back to the Drupal community, meet other Drupal enthusiasts and interact with them building the future of Drupal.  </p>
<h3>Something for everyone</h3>
<p>The sprint on Friday will include three separate events:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/first-time-sprinter-workshop" target="”_blank”">First-Time Sprinter Workshop</a><br />
If you're new to Drupal contribution, you can attend the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/first-time-sprinter-workshop" target="”_blank”">FREE mentored workshop</a> on Friday from 9-noon. The hands-on workshop will cover the basics of contribution essentials like the Drupal.org issue queues, IRC, git, and optionally setting up Drupal 8 on your laptop.</p>
<p>2.  <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/mentored-core-sprint" target="_blank">Mentored Core Sprint</a><br />
If you are already have all the tools, have used the issue queue, have a working Drupal 8 development environment on your laptop, would like to work with a mentor to contribute to Drupal core, and would like help finding an issue to work on, or if you're not quite sure where to start contributing, come to the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/mentored-core-sprint" target="”_blank”">Mentored Core Sprint</a>. This sprint will run all day, with First-Time sprinter workshop attendees joining in the afternoon.  </p>
<p>Sprint mentors will help you find a task for a Drupal core issue and then help you work on it. You can create patches for bugs, add documentation to issues, test patches, and more!</p>
<p>To get a head start, <a href="https://drupal.org/tools">set up your Drupal 8 development environment</a> before Friday. Attend the <a href="https://drupal.org/core-mentoring" target="”_blank”">core office hours</a> from home. Or, at the conference, we will have plenty of opportunities to help get you set up at any of our Get Involved BOFs (times and locations TBD), or you can come to the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/first-time-sprinter-workshop" target="”_blank”">First-Time Sprinter Workshop</a> Friday morning. </p>
<p>3. All the Sprints!<br />
If you're an experienced Drupal contributor, you can head straight to one of the many other <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/add-your-sprints" target="”_blank”">share your sprint initiative</a> to do focused work on one particular area of Drupal, like Views, the Drupal 8 multilingual initiative, the Twig theming system, Migrate, Drupal.org, and more.  </p>
<p>You will work directly with initiative leads and collaborate on issues. This is a great opportunity to make a difference for the Drupal project AND learn from peers how to solve problems! </p>
<h3>Mentor new contributors</h3>
<p>Are you already familiar with setting up a development environment or with the core contribution process? Want to help other contributors? We need about 35 mentors to work with our first-time contributors. Sign up early and secure your mentor t-shirt in the size of your choice.</p>
