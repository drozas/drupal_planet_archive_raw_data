    <div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p>It’s the Friday before DrupalCon Amsterdam, and we couldn’t be more excited for what’s in store. As we prepare to dive headlong into a week filled with fun, friends, and Drupal, there are a few things that all DrupalCon attendees (and would-be attendees) need to be aware of. </p>
<h3>Late pricing ends today</h3>
<p>At 23:59 tonight, ticket pricing will move to onsite prices. You’ll still be able to register for tickets online, but in order to get the late pricing <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/tickets" target="_blank">you must register to attend</a> DrupalCon Amsterdam before midnight tonight Amsterdam time.</p>
<h3>DrupalCon Amsterdam is our biggest European DrupalCon yet</h3>
<p>We’re thrilled to announce that over 2,000 people have registered to attend DrupalCon Amsterdam, which makes it our biggest European DrupalCon to date. With <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/attendees" target="_blank">so many people signed up to attend</a>, there will be tons of opportunities to network, learn, and make new friends.  </p>
<h3>The fun starts before Tuesday</h3>
<p>Excited to get the DrupalCon party started? Many of our amazing community members are starting the celebration early: the Tour de Drupal is <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TourDeDrupal">cruising across Europe</a>, and a student training with over 200 attendees is <a href="https://twitter.com/drupaltd">happening right now</a>, thanks to the local Dutch community.</p>
<p>We wish you safe travels on your way to Amsterdam. Whether you’re taking a plane, a train, a bike, a boat, or some other method of transportation, we hope that you have a fun and safe trip, and we can’t wait to celebrate the best community in Open Sourced with you. </p>
<p>See you in Amsterdam!</p>
