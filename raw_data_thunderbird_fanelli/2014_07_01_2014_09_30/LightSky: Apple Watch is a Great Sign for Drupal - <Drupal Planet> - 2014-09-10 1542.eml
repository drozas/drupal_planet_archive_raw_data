    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Earlier this summer Dries Buytaert, the original creator of <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, had a pretty visionary keynote at DrupalCon, which we talked about in pretty good detail in a<a href="http://www.lightsky.com/podcasts/state-drupal-our-take"> podcast</a>.  One of the things that we mentioned in our analysis of his keynote is that while what Dries was presenting was looking pretty far into the future, it showed that Drupal is being guided on the right path to be positioned well in the future of the web, and Apple's announcement yesterday of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch" target="_blank">Apple Watch</a> just supports this position.  The Apple Watch is exactly the type device that Dries is trying to position Drupal to be ready to feed content to.</p>
<h2>
	Screen Size Could Make the Current Web Obsolete</h2>
<p>Obviously anyone who has looked at the pictures or video of Apple's new watch can immediately see that you aren't going to be viewing a website on it.  Really in any form, a website as we know it won't be displayable on this type of device.  Even the best designers and front-end developers aren't going to be able to make a site responsive down to this size effectively, and the important thing to note is that this is totally ok.  But it is not just small screens that change the way content is going to have to be consumed, big screens cause just as much problem.  We aren't going to be displaying whole websites on billboards, or 6x4 signs found on the sidewalks in major cities, we have to be able to feed content to them.</p>
<h2>
	Be Ready, Change is Coming</h2>
<p>It probably isn't going to quickly eliminate web sites as we know it, but agencies and other organizations need to be ready for change in the way their content is consumed.  Whether it be how products are displayed to potential buyers, your store hours, notifications of sales and events, it doesn't matter what the content is, the way it is consumed will be different in just a matter of months even than it is now.  CMS frameworks need to be ready, and the reality is that many just aren't ready, and aren't headed in the right direction to be ready.  Drupal on the other hand, is on the right track.</p>
