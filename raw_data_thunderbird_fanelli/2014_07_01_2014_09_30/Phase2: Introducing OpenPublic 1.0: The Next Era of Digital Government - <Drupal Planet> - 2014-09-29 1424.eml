    <p dir="ltr">Since 2011, OpenPublic has been transforming government by building government websites and applications which ensure security, mobility, and accessibility. Through our work with numerous government agencies, our teams have developed deep xperts at recognizing and responding to the specific technical challenges faced by public sector organizations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But that doesn’t mean we couldn’t get better &#8211; and we did. As of today, we are proud to introduce the new and improved OpenPublic 1.0. It is the culmination of years of developing content management platforms for federal, state, and local government agencies. With each project, we gained a better understanding of these organizations’ digital needs. From the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a>, to <a href="http://georgia.gov/">Gerogia.gov</a>, to the recent launch of <a href="http://www.smcgov.org/">San Mateo County’s multi-site platform</a>, OpenPublic has evolved to the mature product it is today.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff6600;">What’s New in OpenPublic 1.0?</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr">The 1.0 product version encapsulates all the most important OpenPublic functionality in a <a href="http://phase2technology.com/blog/introducing-openpublics-app-strategy-reimagining-content-management-for-public-sector/">clean collection of Apps</a>, simplifying the distribution’s powerful out-of-the-box capabilities. Not only does OpenPublic 1.0 break the mold by “appifying” what was once a wilderness of modules and complicated Drupal configuration, the newly released product is also fully compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The conception of OpenPublic 1.0 was based on Phase2’s significant experience building government technology solutions. While working with San Mateo County, we developed the idea of using apps to make the distribution’s functionality simple to configure for site administrators. Instead of wading through Drupal’s confusing configuration settings and modules, admins can now turn features on and off without affecting other parts of the platform. Apps like the Services App, Media Room App, Security App, and Workflow App provide distinct segments of functionality specifically designed to complement agencies’ digital needs. In July, Experience Director <a href="http://www.phase2technology.com/blog/introducing-openpublics-app-strategy-reimagining-content-management-for-public-sector/">Shawn Mole elaborated on our OpenPublic App strategy</a> and its potential to transform content management for the public sector.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Open Technology and Government</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr">Like all distributions maintained by Phase2, OpenPublic is built with open technology, with good reason. Government agencies strive to reduce unnecessary costs for their taxpayers, and avoid the recurring licensing fees of proprietary software is a major benefit to open source solutions. Bypassing proprietary vendor lock-ins allows government to leverage the sustainable innovation of an open community working collaboratively to create, improve, and extend functionality, in addition to utilizing the community’s best practices for development. And because open technology is in the public domain, any agency can download, test drive, and learn about potential content management systems before choosing a provider.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.phase2technology.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sm5.png"><img class=" wp-image-8699 aligncenter" alt="sm5" src="http://www.phase2technology.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sm5.png" width="568" height="284" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">San Mateo County, which worked with Phase2 to implement OpenPublic for the county’s CMS, recognized the value of openness in government technology and <a href="https://github.com/smcgov">opened their code to the GitHub community</a>. We were ecstatic that one of our clients embraced the open practices which are not only inherent in our work but laid the foundation for the development of OpenPublic. By making the innovative technology that went into building San Mateo County’s platform available for wider use, San Mateo County contributed to the government’s objective to foster openness, lower costs, and enhance service delivery. The “Open San Mateo” project demonstrates the power of open source to improve not just one government agency, but hundreds simultaneously by making the code available to other governments.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff6600;">OpenPublic Moving Forward</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr">We are hopeful that OpenPublic 1.0 will continue to advance more open government initiatives. In the meantime, Phase2 has several exciting projects in which we’ll show off some of the product’s enhanced features. Keep an eye open for the launch of the <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2014/07/17/interior-drupal-initiative.aspx">Department of the Interior</a> (among others)!</p>
