    <p>Fighting spam is an ongoing cat and mouse game as site owners come up with protections against spam, and spammers come up with increasingly impressive ways to bypass those protections. Solutions like Mollom have been popular in recent years, however Mollom is tied to an external service and only works while that service is running smoothly. Additionally, it costs money if your site has a lot of traffic. CAPTCHA challenges are also a popular solution, but they have accessibility problems -- and automated tools are getting increasingly successful at bypassing them.</p>
