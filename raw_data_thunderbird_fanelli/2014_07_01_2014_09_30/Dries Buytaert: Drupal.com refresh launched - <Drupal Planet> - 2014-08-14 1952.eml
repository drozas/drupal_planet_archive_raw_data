<div class="figure">
<img src="http://buytaert.net/sites/buytaert.net/files/cache/drupal-drupal-com-2005-500x500.jpg" alt="Drupal.com in 2005" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px;"/>
<p>Drupal.com as launched in 2005.</p>

</div>

<p>On August 14 2009, I relaunched <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> to replace the oh-so-embarrassing placeholder page.  The 2009 re-launch turned <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> into a better spotlight for Drupal. It wasn't hard to beat the white page with a Druplicon logo.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="http://buytaert.net/sites/buytaert.net/files/cache/drupal-drupal-com-2009-500x500.jpg" alt="Drupal.com in 2009" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px;"/>
<p>Drupal.com as launched in 2009.</p>

</div>

<p>What was a good spotlight five years ago though is no longer a good spotlight today. Five years later, <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> didn't do Drupal justice.  It didn't really explain what Drupal is, what you can use Drupal for, and more. Along with sub-optimal content, the site wasn't optimized for mobile use either.</p>

<p>Today, exactly five years later to the day, I'm excited to announce that I relaunched <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> again:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="http://buytaert.net/sites/buytaert.net/files/cache/drupal-drupal-com-2014-devices-500x500.jpg" alt="Drupal com devices" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px;"/>

</div>

<p>Redesigning <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> to make it more useful and current has been one of my New Year's resolutions for a number of years now.  And as of today, I can finally strike that off my list.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> has become richer in its content; you'll find a bit more information about Drupal to help people understand what Drupal is all about and how to get started with Drupal. On a desktop, on a tablet, on a phone, the site has become much easier to navigate and read.</p>  

<p>I believe the new <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> is a much better, more relevant showcase for Drupal.  The goal is to update the site more regularly and to keep adding to it. My next step is to add more use cases and to include short demo videos of both the Drupal backend as well as the showcases.  <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> will become an increasingly helpful resource and starting point for people who are evaluating Drupal.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="http://buytaert.net/sites/buytaert.net/files/cache/drupal-drupal-com-2014-mobile-500x500.jpg" alt="Drupal com mobile" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px;"/>

</div>

<p>The changes are not limited to content and look; <a href="http://drupal.com">Drupal.com</a> also has a new engine as the site was upgraded from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 alpha (don't try this at home).  We're using Drupal 8 to push the boundaries of site building and responsive design and to uncover bugs and usability issues with Drupal 8.  Because we're using an alpha version of Drupal 8, things might not function perfectly yet.  We’d still love to hear feedback from designers and front end developers on how it’s working.</p></div></div></div>
