However, when our developers,&nbsp;site-builders and themers are all on the &quot;same page&quot; with code organization and philosophy we are a more effective and efficient team.</p>

<p>After speaking with members of&nbsp;the Drupal community, we believe it is time to start a discussion on how to have a process in place so as to minimize the friction when developing in a team/cooperative&nbsp;environment. In an effort to deep dive into our process&nbsp;this article will be the&nbsp;first in a series of articles discussing our SDP.</p>

<p>A lot of our SDP revolves around how to organize your code so that a&nbsp;developer or site-builder can quickly on-board to a project and larger teams can work together with minimal down-time. The broad pieces of our SDP are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Everything is in code.</li>
	<li>Sites are built using install profiles and the install profiles have a specific directory structure.</li>
	<li><a href="node/90">Install profiles use Drush Make to capture dependencies on external modules, themes, and libraries.</a></li>
	<li>Drupal migrate is used to populate test content during the development phase. (optional)</li>
	<li>Features are used to capture site configuration. (optional)</li>
	<li>While a site is in development all functionality must be present after a fresh site install.</li>
	<li>After a site goes live update hooks can be used to enable new functionality on the production site.</li>
	<li>Use a virtualized environment which mirrors production. (recommended)</li>
</ol>
