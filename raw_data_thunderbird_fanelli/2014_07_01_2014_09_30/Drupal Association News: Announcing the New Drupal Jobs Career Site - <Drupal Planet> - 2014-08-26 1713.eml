The Drupal job market is hot (more on that in a moment) and we hope this new tool will help match the right talent with the right positions.</p>
<p>For job seekers, you can start searching for positions by location, position, skill level and more. You can create a profile with your job preferences and salary requirements, and even choose whether you wish to be contacted by employers and recruiters. All for free.</p>
<p>For employers and recruiters there are a variety of packages available, giving them the opportunity to highlight their company with a branded page and feature select postings in newsletters and social media. The great thing is that proceeds from postings are invested back into Drupal.org and its subsites (including Drupal Jobs) and community programs.</p>
<p>The website is launching today and, as with any new website, we expect there will be some kinks to work out. But we know Drupal Jobs will be a valuable addition to the current options for employers, recruiters and job seekers.</p>
<p>The Drupal job market shows no signs of slowing. Our recently conducted survey points to a strong need for talent (see the chart below). In the next few days we’ll publish the full results of the survey. In the meantime, <a href="http://jobs.drupal.org">check out Drupal Jobs</a> and let us know what you think.</p>
