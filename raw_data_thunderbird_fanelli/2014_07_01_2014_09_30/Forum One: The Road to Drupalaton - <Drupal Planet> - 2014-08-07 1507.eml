    <p>We arrived in beautiful Budapest on Tuesday night already excited for <a href="http://2014.drupalaton.hu/">Drupalaton</a>, Hungary&#8217;s premier annual Drupal event which takes place at the town of Keszthely on Lake Balaton (from which the event gets its name).</p>
<p>Yesterday morning we met up with our friends at the <a href="http://cheppers.com/">Cheppers</a> office, and loaded our bags into the cars to caravan down. Cheppers is one of the major sponsors for Drupalaton, and a good example of the new breed of Drupal shops coming out of Eastern Europe. Incidentally they also happen to be a fantastic road trip crew.</p>
<p>On the way down we talked about what we all hoped to get out of the big Drupal event. Personally I&#8217;m looking forward to a couple of uninterrupted days of contributing to Drupal 8. In a regular work week it&#8217;s hard to get this much time for contribution all at once, and it will be great to feel like I&#8217;m making a dent in the issue queue. Adam Juran, one of our Interface Engineers, talked about the friends we&#8217;d get to see and the &#8220;community track&#8221; of discussing code over a beer, which seems particularly appealing given the dearth of local lakeside restaurants. We&#8217;re seriously considering extending that idea by hosting an unofficial Forum One code sprint on the beach!</p>
<p>Drupalaton promises to be a fantastic conference. These local Drupal events are one of the few places where you can rub shoulders with well-known contributors and local first-timers all at once. Most of these European Drupal camps are fairly intimate gatherings of only about a hundred participants, which means that everyone eats, codes, and hangs out in just one or two big groups. Not to mention, these events are much lower pressure than the larger Drupalcons for everyone involved. People are often running through their presentations for the first time, and very few of them have other project or marketing work to distract them. This means that everyone is there for the same reasons: to code, to learn, and to have fun!</p>
<p>Sure to be one of the highlights of the event program is my three-hour workshop: <a href="http://2014.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-9">Coder vs. Themer: Ultimate Grudge Smackdown Fight to the Death!</a> with my colleague <a href="http://forumone.com/staff/adam-juran">Adam Juran</a>. Adam, using only the theme layer, and I, using only the module layer, will compete and invite our audience to do the same to determine who is able to build the better Drupal website: Coder or Themer?! We&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with this session in the past and it&#8217;s sure to be a popular one among the Drupalaton crowd.</p>
<p>This conference will also include well known Drupal contributors like Morten DK, Wim Leers, Dan Wehner, Reuben Teijieroand of course Gabor Hojtsy. Big names in the community like Stephanie El Hajj and Steve Purkiss will be there too, alongside some of our favorite local Drupal organizers like Lauri Eskola and Zsofi Major. A lot of these people are old friends for us – but whom we often only see on the Drupal.org issue queues – so it&#8217;s a special treat to hang out in person, even if we essentially have the same conversations. As for the people we don&#8217;t yet know: it will be great to code, session, and enjoy some tasty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pálinka">Hungarian Palinka</a> with them as well!</p>

<p>Drupalaton will also feature some of the best of the local Hungarian community, in a beautiful lakeside setting. At <a href="http://forumone.com/agency">Forum One</a> we talk a lot about the value of local engagement with open source products like Drupal, and it&#8217;s very rewarding to be a part of that core value in action. Hungarian Drupalists are some of the most talented – not to mention friendly! – in the European community. We&#8217;ll definitely post more when the con gets started!</p>
