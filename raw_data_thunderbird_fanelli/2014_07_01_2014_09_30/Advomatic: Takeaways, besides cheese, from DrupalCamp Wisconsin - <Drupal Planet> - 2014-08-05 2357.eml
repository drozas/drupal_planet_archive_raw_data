    <p>Everybody knows that Wisconsin is home of <a href="https://www.noahsarkwaterpark.com">America&#39;s largest water park</a>, the <a href="http://www.iwantthenews.com/main.asp?SectionID=9&amp;SubSectionID=11&amp;ArticleID=14251"> world&rsquo;s largest barber pole</a>, the <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2255">world&rsquo;s largest penny</a>, and the <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2444">world&rsquo;s largest talking cow</a>. Another thing to know is that Wisconsin is also home to a very active Drupal community and July&#39;s excellent <a href="http://drupalcampwi.com/â€‹">DrupalCamp</a>!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a few years since my last Drupal conference, so DrupalCamp was a great opportunity to catch up on new best practices and get a little reassurance that Drupal 8 isn&rsquo;t something I should fear as a developer.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights from a few sessions I attended:</p>
<h5>Using Drupal for Government and Open Data Projects</h5>
<p>Government sites pose unique challenges, and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/13085">Sheldon Rampton</a> explained how Drupal can be leveraged to accommodate for these issues if you plan well. Sheldon focused on hosting, architecture, standards, process and project management, and I definitely appreciated him referring to developers as &ldquo;the talent&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;the resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can see his slides <a href="http://www.drupalcampwi.com/sites/default/files/uploads/slides/drupal_best_practices_for_government.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a related talk, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/443462">Janette Day</a> gave us an overview of DKAN, a Drupal platform for handling open data. Using Drupal for open data projects makes sense - open data should be open source, and Drupal allows non-technical users to manage content. Drupal can also help an organization modernize antiquated systems and escape from expensive software licenses.</p>
<p>You can check out my notes <a href="https://gist.github.com/sarahg/Da54092d0d059c76cc6b0">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Other Cool Projects</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/dsnopek">David Snopek</a> gave us a run-down of Drupal distributions with a focus on Panopoly, which adheres to UX principles that really streamline the content-creating experience. I haven&rsquo;t used Panopoly on a project myself, but I&rsquo;d absolutely give it (or some of its components) a spin next time I&rsquo;m tasked with hooking up a WYSIWYG or making in-place editing more client-friendly.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/advomatic.com/presentation/d/1uiypKtLHjFvRhdoFeNZnRXylQiqoyxcZ4_K_c97sDKI/edit#slide=id.g2b8866dc6_00">Here are the slides.</a></p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever run into trouble on your site with managing dependencies among your modules, go check out <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/1013988">Jim Rath &#39;s</a> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/elephant.jim/2293323">module dependency grapher</a>. Using a custom Drush command, the dependency analyzer will inspect your modules and generate a chart which illustrates the dependencies between them.</p>
<p>You can check out everything else from DrupalCamp&nbsp;that I bookmarked up at <a href="https://pinboard.in/search/u:hey_germano?query=drupalcampWI2014">https://pinboard.in/search/u:hey_germano?query=drupalcampWI2014</a></p>
