    <p>Since Twig autoescape is on, there are <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2289999">double escape bugs</a>. If you can fix them by refactoring code into Twig templates, that's great. If not then wait for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2289999">an easy way to create HTML on the fly without having to create a theme function / template</a>. It's already RTBC, it's a matter of days to find its way in. Regarding <code>SafeMarkup::set</code> calls, there is an issue to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2297703">refactor and remove</a> the ones we needed to add to get tests pass and so adding more is not acceptable (the reason for writing this announcement are the quick fix issues I need to whack trying to fix double escape by adding more of these).</p>
