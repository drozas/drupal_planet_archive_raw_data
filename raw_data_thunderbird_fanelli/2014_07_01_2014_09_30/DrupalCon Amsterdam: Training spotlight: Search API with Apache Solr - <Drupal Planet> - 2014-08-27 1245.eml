<p>The team at Zivtech have developed open source tools which make setting up ApacheSolr instances and Search API configurations a breeze. </p>
<p>Instructor Jody Hamilton will walk you through set up and will introduce you to these tools at the beginning of the training, ensuring everyone quickly has a working ApacheSolr instance on a local sandbox site. Together you will build Views with Search API, and add and configure facets with Facet API. Students will use drush to work with with the search index, and finally the class will look at how you can improve search results relevancy and add custom fields to the index with a custom module. </p>
<h3>Meet the Trainer from Zivtech</h3>
<p>Jody Hamilton (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/112500" target="_blank">Jody Lynn</a>) is Co-Founder / CTO at Zivtech and has been giving public and private Drupal trainings for 6 years, including at the past 4 US DrupalCons. </p>
<h3>Attend this Drupal Training</h3>
<p>This training will be held on Monday, 29 September from 09:00-17:00 at the Amsterdam RAI during DrupalCon Amsterdam. The cost of attending this training is â‚¬400 and includes training materials, meals and coffee breaks. A DrupalCon ticket is not required to register to attend this event. </p>
<p>Our training courses are designed to be small enough to provide attendees plenty of one-on-one time with the instructor, but large enough that they are a good use of the instructor's time. Each training course must meet its minimum sign-up number by 5 September in order for the course to take place. You can help to ensure your training course takes place by registering before this date and reminding friends and colleagues to attend.</p>
