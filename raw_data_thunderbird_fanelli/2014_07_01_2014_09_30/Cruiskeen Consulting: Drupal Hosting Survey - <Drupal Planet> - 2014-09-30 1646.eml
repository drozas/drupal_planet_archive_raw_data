We are doing some infrastructure and software planning at the moment, and we thought it would be great to get some feedback from the Drupal community as a whole.</p>
<p>We are conducting this as an open source survey - that is, we're planning on making the results publicly available after the survey closes.Â  We're planning on leaving the survey up through the end of October, so if you're interested in informing the decisions of hosting companies catering to Drupal, <a href="http://cruiskeenconsulting.com/content/drupal-hosting-survey">please come fill out the survey. </p>
