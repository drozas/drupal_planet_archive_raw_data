<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>INTERIOR. RONNIE’S APARTMENT – EVENING<br />
(<em>RONNIE paces, on the phone.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>RONNIE</strong>: Jeremy, I have a bit of a problem. My Drupal guru-guy got two million dollars seed capital for his start-up and moved to Palo Alto. But I was thinking, maybe you should send me to DrupalCon Austin...  Why? So I can experience the whole Drupal community-thing first-hand... Really?... <em>Awesome!</em></p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>EXTERIOR. CONVENTION CENTER – ESTABLISHING SHOT – MORNING<br />
(<em>RONNIE enters the massive Neal Kocurek Memorial Austin Convention Center, along with hundreds of enthusiastic Drupalists.</em>)</p>
<p>[TITLE: DRUPALCON. DAY ONE]</p>
<p>INT. CONVENTION CENTER, REGISTRATION AREA<br />
(<em>Ronnie approaches a heavily costumed gentleman and explains that he is interviewing attendees for an article in Drupal Watchdog. HILMAR HALLBJÖRNSSON, a Drupal developer from Iceland, readily agrees to be questioned. Ronnie sets his cellphone to Record.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>RONNIE:</strong> Hilmar, why the helmet and horns? </p>
<p><strong>HILMAR:</strong> Three days before I came here, I saw Morten DK announcing a big Vikings party and claiming that Vikings came from Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>RONNIE:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>HILMAR:</strong> Well, everyone with a little knowledge of Vikings knows there are as many genuine Vikings in Denmark as there are high mountains. Which is: none.</p>
<p><strong>RONNIE:</strong> So...?</p>
<p><strong>HILMAR:</strong> So I decided to show him who was the boss.</p>
<p><strong>RONNIE:</strong> And you showed him?</p>
<p><strong>HILMAR:</strong> He was defeated and knelt before me.</p>
<p>INT. CONVENTION CENTER – LATER<br />
(<em>Exiting Exhibit Hall, Ronnie keeps up with a scurrying man-on-a-mission: JASON MOSS, an applications developer for the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> This is my fourth DrupalCon and what makes it most favorable over the last three is that it’s in a <em>warm</em> place.</p>
<p><strong>RONNIE:</strong> Uh-huh. But aside from the weather –</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> – I always get a lot of little tidbits and useful tips at Drupalcon. It’s what keeps me coming.</p>
<p><strong>RONNIE:</strong> Did you hear Dries’s keynote speech?</p>        </div>
