    <p>A quick note to all the Drupalists in the DC general area &ndash; Forum One is trying to put together a D8 core sprint in their DC office space. They&rsquo;re coordinating with the DC Meetup group to try and spread the word to as many community members as possible!</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been to a code sprint before, it&rsquo;s basically a coding party. Developers get together and help each other contribute better and faster by reviewing code on the spot, mentoring each other, and generally working in small ad-hoc groups. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun, and gives a big boost to development of the next generation of Drupal.</p>

<p>Forum One will provide the locale in downtown DC complete with pizza, beer, and soda. We also have a few of our core mentors on hand to help you get started if this is your first time contributing to core. Because of the building security, if you want to attend you <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/drupal-8-code-sprint-with-forum-one-tickets-11921354091">have to register first</a>! I won&rsquo;t be able to attend, but my colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/johnbburg">John Brandenburg</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kalpanagoel">Kalpana Goel</a> will be there mentoring. Go sign up now!</p>
