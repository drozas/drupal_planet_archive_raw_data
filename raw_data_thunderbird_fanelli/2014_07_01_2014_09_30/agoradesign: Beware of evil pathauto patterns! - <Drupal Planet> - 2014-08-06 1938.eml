          <div class="field-item even"><p>Recently, a very mysterious problem has cost us quite a lot of time and some headache too.

According to an issue on drupal.org, that I will mention later, it may also occur with PostegreSQL, but most likely not with MySQL. But I also have a general advice regarding pathauto patterns and best practices.</p>
