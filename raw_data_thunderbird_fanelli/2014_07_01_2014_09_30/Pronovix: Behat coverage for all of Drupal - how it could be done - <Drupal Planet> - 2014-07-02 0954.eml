    <p>There is a lot of excitement in the Drupal community about Behat, especially from more advanced teams that are investing in their Devops infrastructure. It now even looks like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2232271">Behat might some day make it into Drupal core</a>. I guess that is why several Web development teams that use BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) have asked me how WalkHub relates to Behat. Iâ€™ve written a <a href="http://walkhub.net/content/how-you-could-record-and-visualize-bdd-scenarios-walkhub">longer post on the WalkHub blog</a> that explains how it could be done, and what the benefits would be. In this post I will focus on how WalkHub could help the community complete the creation of Behat tests for all of Drupal core and contrib.</p>
