          <div class="field-item" property="schema:text"><p>It has been a weekend in the spirit of <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/headless-drupal">headless Drupal</a>, front-end optimizations and server side hacks. The result is I updated my blog to Drupal 8. Since you are reading this, it must mean it is live.</p>
<p>First let's start with the cold facts (almost chronologically ordered by request lifetime):</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org">Varnish</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a></li>
<li>Drupal 8</li>
<li><a href="http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/">Mihtril.js</a></li>
<li>Core REST module for all resources</li>
</ul><p>Other front-end technologies used that does not directly relate to the request itself:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a></li>
</ul><h2>So, HHVM, huh?</h2>
<p>Yeah, that's mostly just a novelty act. There is no real gain there. Quite the opposite, I have added some hacks to get around some limitations. </p>
<p>HHVM does not work very well with logged in users right now, but works alright for serving anonymous content.</p>
<h2>When I reload and look at the source code, there is no css loading. WAT?</h2>
<p>Yeah, I am just assuming you remember the styles from last page load. Also, I have made it an image to have a 1 HTTP request CMS, right?</p>
<h2>No, really. How does that work?</h2>
<p>The real magic is happening by checking if you as a user already have downloaded my page earlier. If you have, I don't need to serve you css, as far as I am concerned. You should have saved that last time, so I just take care of that.</p>
<h2>OK, so you use a cookie and save css in localstorage. Does that not screw with the varnish cache</h2>
<p>Good question. I have some logic to internally rewrite the cached pages with a key to the same varnish hash. This way, all users trying to look at a css-less page with the css stored in localstorage will be served the same page, and php will not get touched.</p>
<h2>What a great idea!</h2>
<p>Really? Are you really sure you have thought of all the limitations? Because they are many. But seeing as this is my personal tech blog, and I like to experiment, it went live anyway. </p>
<h2>Give us the code!</h2>
<p>Sure. <a href="https://github.com/eiriksm/orkjern_theme">The theme is at github</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/eiriksm/orkjern_theme_cache">stupid cache module is at github</a>. Please be aware that it is a very bad idea to use it if you have not read the code and understand what it does.</p>
<p>And since I am feeling pretty bad ass right now, let's end with Clint Eastwood as an animated gif.</p>
