This blog post is part of a series (see <a href="https://www.paragon-es.de/blog/drd-and-drush-part-1-4">part 1 of 4</a>) that describes all the possibilities around these two powerful tools. This is part 2 which describes on how to trigger any of DRD's actions from the command line by utilizing Drush.</p></div></div></div>
