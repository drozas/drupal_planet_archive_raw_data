<p><img src="/files/The_world620x543_margin_right.png" alt="The World Today magazine issue" align="right" width="400px" /></p><p>
They decided to rebuild their website to better promote their independent analysis and new research on international affairs, engaging with their audiences and disseminating their output as widely as possible in the interests of ultimately influencing all international decision-makers and -shapers.
</p>
<p>
They wanted a modern, responsive website with a clean design that would provide a better user experience and increased traffic. Additionally, one of the requirements was to integrate the website with their events and membership management software. </p>
<p>
Chatham House have used Drupal as their CMS of choice since summer 2011. Their previous Drupal 6 based website was suffering from intermittent performance issues, a dated, non-responsive design and did not integrate with Chatham House’s internal membership management software.</p>
<p>
Chatham House worked with <a href="http://www.torchbox.com" rel="nofollow">Torchbox</a> to produce a new, modern and responsive design on a new Drupal 7 instance. A lot of previous custom code was replaced with tried and tested combinations of contrib modules and a large, rolling content migration (more than 10,000 items) was required to move content from the old Drupal 6 site to the new Drupal 7 site.</p>
<p>
Chatham House’s membership management software was also integrated with their new Drupal 7 website for user authentication and events content.</p>
