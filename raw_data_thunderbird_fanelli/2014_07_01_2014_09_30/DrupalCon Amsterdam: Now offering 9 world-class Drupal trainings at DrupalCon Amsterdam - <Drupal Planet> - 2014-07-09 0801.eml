<p>One of the most important sessions I taught as a technical consultant was the one week Drupal Jumpstart. Here, my students learn how to do everything in Drupal from adding content, and installing modules on day 1, all the way to setting up complex multiple content-type relationships and combining their displays using panels and views on day 5.</p>

<h3><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/node/2808">An Effective Development Workflow in Drupal 8</a></h3>
<p>It’s been a long time since Features made news. Most Drupal developers are now familiar with a development workflow based on Features, and possibly Profiles and Makefiles (a “code-driven workflow”, as we call it). But Drupal 8 is coming, and it will be revolutionary. How will you be able to be as effective in Drupal 8 as you are now in Drupal 7?</p>

<p>Responsive Web Design is on everyone's mind at the moment, and for good reason. With more mobile device activations per day than human births and full internet browsers coming to television sets and gaming consoles (both home and portable), the old techniques we have used to create pixel perfect sites for desktop audiences have already become a thing of the past.</p>
