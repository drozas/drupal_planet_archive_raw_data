<p>The great thing about Condition Plugins, is they are re-usable chunks of code, and many contrib projects will be able to take advantage of them (Page Manager, Panels, Rules anyone?)</p>
<p>In this post, I show how you can create an example Page Message module that uses a RequestPath condition plugin to show a message on a configured page.</p>
