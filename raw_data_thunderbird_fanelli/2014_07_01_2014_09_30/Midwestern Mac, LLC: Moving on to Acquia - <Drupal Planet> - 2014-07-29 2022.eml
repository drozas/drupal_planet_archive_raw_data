<p>What does this mean for this site/blog, Hosted Apache Solr, and Server Check.in? Not much, actuallyâ€”they will continue on, likely at the same pace of development they've been for the past year or so (I'll work on them when I get an odd hour or two...). I am still working on completing <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">Ansible for DevOps</a>, and will actually be accelerating my writing schedule prior to starting the new job, since I'll have a little wedge of free time (a.k.a. unemployment!) between Mercy (my current full-time employer) and Acquia.</p></div></div></div>
