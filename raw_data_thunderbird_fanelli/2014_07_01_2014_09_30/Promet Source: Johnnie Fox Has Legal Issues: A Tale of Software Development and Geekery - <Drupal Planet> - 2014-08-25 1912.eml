    <p dir="ltr">Q: What do a group of lawyers and a group of Drupal tech geeks have in common?</p>
<p dir="ltr">My first presentation at a conference with this new, fancy title of "CTO" was Imagine, an annual event for the International Legal Technology Association. I had come to the <a href="http://conference.iltanet.org/">ILTA Conference</a> with the expectation that in many ways, I’d be the tech geek, sticking out like an astronaut at a rodeo. I mean, the law industry? That’s an industry known for being sleek. And here I am, a glasses-clad CTO from a <a href="http://www.prometsource.com/service/web-development">web development </a>shop... A leading nerd of nerds. Looking out into a sea of bright-eyed individuals who could easily be mistaken for Drupal camp attendees, I realized “I am in my element. It doesn’t matter in what industry I am presenting; it only matters that I am amongst my people: the tech world.”</p>
