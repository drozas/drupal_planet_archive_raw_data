    <h4>Welcome to the second This Month in Drupal Documentation!</h4>
<p>"This Month in Drupal Documentation" (TMIDD) is an approximately monthly update from the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">Documentation Working Group (DocWG)</a> on what has been happening in Drupal Documentation in the last month or so. Sorry... because this is posted in the Core group as well as Documentation, comments are disabled.</p>
<p>If you have comments or suggestions, please see the DocWG home page for how to contact us. Thanks!</p>
<h3>Notable Documentation Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>A lot of work was done on the Drupal 8 core Help pages (admin/help within a Drupal site) this month, by many contributors. We still have a few Core modules that need to have their help reviewed or updated from what it was in Drupal 7. To help out, see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1908570" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/1908570">https://www.drupal.org/node/1908570</a> -- find a child issue in the sidebar that is still open.</li>
<li>Progress was also made on the developer documentation embedded in Drupal Core source code files. There's an effort underway to make sure that if you go to <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/8" title="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/8">https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/8</a> (the Drupal 8 landing page for API docs), you'll see a list of the key developer topics, and if you click through to any of them, they'll give you the essentials and link you to further details. The landing page is up, and this month most of the landing pages were filled in. If you'd like to help complete this project, see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2148255" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/2148255">https://www.drupal.org/node/2148255</a> -- find a child issue in the sidebar that is either "active" (needs to be written) or "needs review" (has a patch that needs to be reviewed).</li>
<li>brycefisherfleig updated the documentation for the Video module: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/video" title="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/video">https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/video</a></li>
<li>lolandese wrote documentation for the Flickr module: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2170535" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/2170535">https://www.drupal.org/node/2170535</a></li>
<li>Sutharsan and others updated documentation for Drupal 6/7 to 8 migration: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/upgrade/migrate" title="https://www.drupal.org/upgrade/migrate">https://www.drupal.org/upgrade/migrate</a></li>
<li>Many people wrote and updated Drupal 8 programmer documentation: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8" title="https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8">https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8</a></li>
<li>acabouet updated titles for a lot of pages so they were clearer. You can do this too -- see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks/fix-page-titles" title="https://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks/fix-page-titles">https://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks/fix-page-titles</a></li>
<li>andreathegiant and others updated the documentation for COD (Conference Organizing Distribution): <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1837770" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/1837770">https://www.drupal.org/node/1837770</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Thanks for contributing!</h3>
<p>Since May 29th (<a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/425068">our previous TMIDD post)</a>, 262 contributors have made 1216 (wow!) total Drupal.org documentation page revisions, including 8 people that made more than 30 edits (lolandese, acabouet, drupalshrek, jhodgdon, gisle, realityloop, brycefisherfleig, and Gábor Hojtsy) -- thanks everyone!</p>
<p>In addition, there were many many commits to Drupal Core and contributed projects that improved documentation -- these are hard to count, because many commits combine code and documentation -- but they are greatly appreciated too!</p>
<h3>Documentation Priorities</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/priorities">Current documentation priorities page</a> is always a good place to look to figure out what to work on, and has been updated recently.</p>
<p>If you're new to contributing to documentation, these projects may seem a bit overwhelming -- so why not try out a <a href="https://drupal.org/contributor-tasks/writers">New contributor task</a> to get started?</p>

<h3>Report from the Working Group</h3>
<ul>
<li>We've been working on the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/documentation-policies">Policies section of the DocWG pages</a>, and it's taking shape. So far, it mostly contains existing policies, but we also recently discussed and adopted <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2291989">guidelines for what to do about obsolete documentation</a> and added it there.</li>
<li>We've streamlined the <a href="https://drupal.org/contribute/documentation">Contribute to Documentation pages</a> so that they're actually possible to read in one sitting. There was a lot of obsolete and duplicated information in there; not so much now!</li>
<li>We are still looking through all of the suggestions and ideas the community has had in the past for how to improve documentation policies, procedures, and tools (and achieve our goals). We are getting closer to making a list of priorities... watch this space for updates!</li>
<li>Video files can now be updated on drupal.org on documentation (and other) pages. Check out this issue for more information: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1246118" title="https://drupal.org/node/1246118">https://drupal.org/node/1246118</a></li>
<li>The software on <a href="https://api.drupal.org" title="https://api.drupal.org">https://api.drupal.org</a> was recently updated, mostly with new features for Drupal 8, including a list of Services (see right sidebar navigation) and displaying Traits. Thanks to the infrastructure team for making this possible (the new Drupal 8 features required PHP 5.4, and the site is running PHP 5.3, so it was a bit tricky!).</li>
