One great advantage this has is it gives developers time to backport lots of the features Drupal 8 has in core as modules for Drupal 7. My inspiration and blatant rip-off for this blog came from the presentation fellow Lullabot Dave Reid did at Drupalcon Austin about how to Future-Proof Your Drupal 7 Site. Dave’s presentation was more about what you can do to make your Drupal 7 “ready” where this article is more about showing off Drupal 8 “hotness” that we can use in production today.</p>
