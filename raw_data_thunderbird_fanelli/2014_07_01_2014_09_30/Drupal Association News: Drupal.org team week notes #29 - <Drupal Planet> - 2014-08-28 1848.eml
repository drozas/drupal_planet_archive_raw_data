<h2>Better credit for organizations on Drupal.org</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://drupal.org/news/supporting-organizations-credit-on-profiles">added a feature to projects on Drupal.org to help highlight the contributions made by supporting organizations</a>. Maintainers of distributions, modules, and themes can give credit to organizations that have materially contributed to projects on Drupal.org using the new “Supporting Organizations" field.</p>
<p>If you are a project maintainer, take a moment to give some credit to the organizations that have helped build the Drupal ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Drupal Jobs launch</h2>
<p>We’re proud to announce the launch of <a href="https://jobs.drupal.org/">Drupal Jobs</a>, a career site dedicated completely to Drupal. The Drupal job market is hot and we hope this new tool will help match the right talent with the right positions.</p>
<p>For job seekers, you can start searching for positions by location, position, skill level and more. You can create a profile with your job preferences and salary requirements, and even choose whether you wish to be contacted by employers and recruiters. All for free.</p>
<p>For employers and recruiters there are a variety of packages available, giving them the opportunity to highlight their company with a branded page and feature select postings in newsletters and social media. The great thing is that proceeds from postings are invested back into Drupal.org and its subsites (including Drupal Jobs) and community programs.</p>
<h2>Upcoming deployments</h2>
<p>We are slowly moving towards implementing the new layout for user profiles on Drupal.org. In the coming weeks we will be migrating profile fields to user fields bit by bit. Profile layout will be changing along the way and might look messy at times during migration.</p>
<p>Next week we are planning to deploy software and infrastructure changes to support <a href="https://www.drupal.org/news/introducing-drupalorg-tos-and-privacy-policy">the new Drupal.org Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</a>. We are going to implement a checkbox on user profiles, so that users could accept the ToS and Privacy Policy, as well as a few other changes.</p>
<h2>Previous deployments</h2>

<h2>Drupal.org infrastructure news</h2>
<p>The load balancers are being rebuilt with a new operating system and configuration.  These rebuilds bring decreased latency and increased security to our *.drupal.org sites.  Since the beginning of August our average latency has decreased from ~1000ms to ~400ms.</p>
<p><img src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/screen.png" /></p>
<p>More statistics are available from <a href="http://status.devdrupal.org/433372/2014/08">status.devdrupal.org</a>.</p>
<p>Drupal.org web servers have also been upgraded to a 3.14 kernel with the latest grsecurity patch.</p>
<p>There has also been a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2228897">review of cache values on drupal.org</a> sites.</p>
<p>---<br />
As always, we’d like to say thanks to all volunteers who are working with us and to the Drupal Association <a href="https://drupal.org/supporters">Supporters</a>, who made it possible for us to work on these projects. </p>
