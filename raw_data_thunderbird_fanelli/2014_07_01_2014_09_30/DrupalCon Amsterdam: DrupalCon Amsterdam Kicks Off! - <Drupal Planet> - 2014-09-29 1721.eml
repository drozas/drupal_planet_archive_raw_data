We're excited to welcome more than 2,000 developers, designers, IT professionals and business executives from all over the world to Drupal’s largest-ever event in Europe. </p>
<p>We're especially excited to celebrate the progress made toward a Drupal 8 release. All critical “beta blocker” issues have been fixed and a beta version of Drupal 8 is the next step. Drupal 8 is full of promising improvements for developers, site builders, themers, IT professionals and marketers, and we can't wait to get it ready for the world. </p>
<h3>Watch DrupalCon Live</h3>
<p>DrupalCon Amsterdam will open this morning with a keynote from Dries Buytaert at 9:00 CEST -- but if you aren't in Amsterdam, don't worry! You can catch a live stream of the keynote (and Prenote!) <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/live">here</a>, courtesy of Brightcove. </p>
<p>The keynote promises to be fantastic -- Dries will discuss Drupal 8, as well as new ideas for how project contributors can be recognized. The Wednesday keynote will be excellent, as author and activist Cory Doctorow will take the stage to talk about net neutrality, privacy, and security. Doctorow’s keynote will be followed by a book signing. </p>
