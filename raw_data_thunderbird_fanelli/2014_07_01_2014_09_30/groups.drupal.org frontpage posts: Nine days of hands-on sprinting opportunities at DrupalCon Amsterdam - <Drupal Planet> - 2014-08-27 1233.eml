    <p><a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/427578">DrupalCon Amsterdam community sprints</a> are starting in just one month from today. We have a great tradition to organize sprinting opportunities throughout DrupalCon days and also the weekends before and after. If you have been to them, you know the power of these events, but if you are new to our sprints, here are some quotes from an earlier sprint at Drupal Dev Days Szeged:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two days working with the Drupal Community [...] help you to learn more than one week working alone at home :) -- <a href="https://twitter.com/javisr/statuses/449159591373586432" title="https://twitter.com/javisr/statuses/449159591373586432">https://twitter.com/javisr/statuses/449159591373586432</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Greatest thing about code sprints: Hearing respected core devs say "I don't understand that." "Me neither." We all learn. [...] -- <a href="https://twitter.com/marcvangend/statuses/449442724966858752" title="https://twitter.com/marcvangend/statuses/449442724966858752">https://twitter.com/marcvangend/statuses/449442724966858752</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Drupal sprints are a wonderful combination of a lot of top Drupal developers working on important problems in the same space without other distractions going on. We even secured a wonderful sprint location for the weekends, the <a href="https://plus.google.com/+Meetberlage">Berlage Workspace</a>. You can help move important issues forward and learn the tricky details faster than anybody else while working with others.</p>

<p>Sprints announced so far include frontend, drupal.org, search API, multilingual, Behavior Driven Development, Panopoly, Rules in Drupal 8, Media in Drupal 8, Migration to Drupal 8, Content staging in Drupal 8 and a dedicated group of people driving critical Drupal 8 issues in general. Each team is being lead by Drupal topic experts so you can work with the top people in the field.</p>
<p>The most active days expected in decreasing order are Friday, Monday and Sunday before and Saturday after, but sprinting opportunities are almost always available throughout the nine days. <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=4j8sqq5fphhpgmrtfl8t2ggkes%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Amsterdam">We even created a Google Calendar</a> that you can subscribe to (<a href="mailto:4j8sqq5fphhpgmrtfl8t2ggkes@group.calendar.google.com">4j8sqq5fphhpgmrtfl8t2ggkes@group.calendar.google.com</a>) which contains all the sprint venue information at any point in time, so you know where to find active Drupal sprinters. Or just <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/427578">check out the announcement for more information</a>.</p>
<p>The sprints would not happen without the sponsorship of the Drupal Association, Acquia and Open8. Huge thanks for their support!</p>
