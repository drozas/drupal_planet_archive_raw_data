We did this to better protect our users and their data, but it had the unfortunate consequence of making it much more difficult, if not impossible, to trace outbound referral traffic from Drupal.org.</p>
<h2>
	I have a Marketplace listing. What does this mean for me?</h2>
<p>For companies with marketplace listings or any links pointing to their websites from Drupal.org, this means that, while you may be getting plenty of visitors to your website from Drupal.org or its associated properties, this will not show up in Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Unless you’ve tagged your links with campaign data, you’ll have no way of knowing who comes to your website from Drupal.org— though you will receive the SEO benefits from having that link in place.</p>
<h2>
	How do I fix this? I want referral information!</h2>
<p>Fortunately, getting referral traffic data from Drupal.org can actually be really easy! All you have to do is tag the URLs on your organization page to include campaign information, and you can use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en">this handy tool from Google</a> to do it. If you’re not using Google Analytics, most analytics platforms have a URL builder that will let you add campaign tags.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it. It’s an easy fix to the problem, and everybody wins: you’ll still get your referral information, and our users stay safe thanks to HTTPS!</p>
