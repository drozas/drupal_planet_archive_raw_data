    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p><img alt="" src="http://www.lightsky.com/sites/default/files/screen_shot_2014-09-16_at_4.30.30_pm.png" style="width: 300px; height: 148px; float: right; margin: 10px;" />LightSky recently welcomed <a href="http://www.columbusmennonite.org" target="_blank">Columbus Mennonite Church</a> to the ranks of <a href="http://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a> users with the launch of their new Drupal 7 site.  Columbus Mennonite Church is located in Columbus, Ohio, and was looking for a site that would help them not only help drive their message to members of the community and welcome people with open arms, but also that could help streamline some internal processes among their congregation.  Drupal offered an excellent platform to build the Columbus Mennonite site on, giving them what they needed now, and not preventing them from growing into the future. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.lightsky.com/sites/default/files/screen_shot_2014-09-16_at_4.30.56_pm_0.png" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; float: left; margin: 10px;" />While a responsive design wasn't in the works for Columbus Mennonite, careful attention was paid to how things worked and looked on devices of all sizes, and the Drupal platform provides Columbus Mennonite a firm foundation with which to add a responsive design down the road.  Columbus Mennonite's beautiful forward facing design isn't the end of what their site offers though, as we created a great members only functionality that allows them to share certain information on their site with only members.  This allows them to distribute information to their congregation without having to worry about whether or not it is appropriate for the general public to have access to.  For churches this is a much needed feature to keep the congregation in touch with each other in the digital age.  Not only is there a members only section, but LightSky was also able to streamline their worship scheduling allowing schedulers to make changes to individual responsibilities each week, while allowing the congregation to view the schedule and find out if their help is needed.</p>
<p>As part of this project LightSky launched the new site on Pantheon, a hosting platform that provides some of the best stability and uptime by being fine tuned for the Drupal framework.  </p>
