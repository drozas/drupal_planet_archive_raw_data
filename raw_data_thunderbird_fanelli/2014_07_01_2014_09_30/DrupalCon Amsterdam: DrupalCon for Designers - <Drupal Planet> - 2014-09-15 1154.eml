    <div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p>Unlike DrupalCon Austin, there is no separate UX track at DrupalCon Amsterdam. Ruben and I had to balance both design and development into one track. It was challenging, but it forced us to be really careful about every decision remade.</p>
<p>We really wanted there to be an overlap between sessions, frontend development and design are closer than ever in the workplace, so we wanted to reflect that in our session line up.</p>
<p>Here are a few sessions we think complement each other really well.</p>
<h3><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/state-front-end" target="_blank">The State of the Frontend</a></h3>
<p>Not sure what to learn or where to start in frontend development? Let David and Brian guide you through the landscape, introducing new tools and techniques. </p>
<p>We've also planned this session as an introduction to the entire track, pointing signposts towards other sessions in that track that can fill in more in-depth knowledge about particular subjects. I would encourage everyone with an interest in frontend development to attend the session if only to better understand which sessions in the frontend track are right for them.</p>
<p>We also have a few session that compliment and feed in to each other. Here are a few sessions we think work really well together.</p>
<h3><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/because-its-about-interactions-better-ux-through-prototyping" target="_blank">Because it's about the interactions. (Better UX through prototyping)</a>  &amp; <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/axure-prototyping-drupal" target="_blank">Axure Prototyping for Drupal</a></h3>
<p>How do we shift from an old design process to a new one while keeping our clients and team members happy? Roy Scholten, UX co-maintainer for Drupal Core, walks us through why prototyping is a better way to design and how to introduce this into your work life.</p>
<p>Then, in Axure Prototyping for Drupal, Dani Nordin takes us on a deep dive of <a href="http://www.axure.com/" target="_blank">Axure</a>, a prototyping tool you can use without coding. I've been using it recently on a client project and I've been impressed with the way it introduces some concepts of  frontend development without asking you to write code.</p>
<h3><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/future-html-and-css" target="_blank">The Future of HTML and CSS</a></h3>
<p>As a designer, knowing the limits and capabilities of your medium is important, also it means you can call your developers out when they hit you with “That's not possible” which is fun. If you're interested in seeing where web browsers are heading and finding new tricks to add to your repertoire, Preston's talk on The Future of HTML and CSS  should be a treat.</p>
<h3><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/getting-clue-command-line" target="_blank">Getting a CLUE at the Command Line</a></h3>
<p>As a designer/front-end dev, I've never had a formal education on the command line, it's always been something I've picked up as I've needed it. It used to scare me. This is me using the command line a few years ago:<br /><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/Cki0n5fW6L0cM/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>I'm so happy Emma Jane is talking on the command line in Getting a CLUE at the Command Line in the same vein as her <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/git-makes-me-angry-inside" target="_blank">introduction to Git</a> at DrupalCon Prague last year. The command line is an immensely powerful and productive tool and I'm looking forward to picking up a few tips.</p>
<h3><a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/open-source-design" target="_blank">Open Source Design</a></h3>
<p>Something I've struggled with, both in my day job and as the maintainer of Drupal's admin theme is how do we bring successful design together with Open Source. I'm really happy that <a href="http://jancborchardt.net/" target="_blank">Jan-C. Borchardt</a>, agreed to speak at DrupalCon and share his knowledge and experience with us. Jan is a big supporter of usability and design in free and open source software, with projects including A guide to <a href="http://jancborchardt.net/usability-in-free-software" target="_blank">Usability in Free Software</a>, <a href="http://owncloud.org/" target="_blank">OwnCloud</a>, <a href="http://libreprojects.net/#favs=joindiaspora-com,owncloud,openstreetmap,jamendo,cloud9,plos" target="_blank">Libre Projects</a>, and the brilliant <a href="https://tosdr.org/" target="_blank">Terms of Service; Didn't Read</a>. </p>
<p>It's really important for Drupal for us to gain insight from people outside the community and learn from other projects. Thanks again Jan for agreeing to speak! I can't wait!</p>
