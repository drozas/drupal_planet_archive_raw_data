As Commerce 2.x development heats up, we’ll be covering interesting developments, ideas, and contributors.</p>
<p>Our first topic of interest is internationalization and localization. This involves tasks from translating UIs and content to representing numbers, currencies, and dates in a locale specific manner. It’s also a current pain point with Drupal 7 / Commerce 1.x - especially as it relates to currency management.</p>
