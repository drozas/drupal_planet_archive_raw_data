We’re anticipating several hundred individuals sign up for to join the <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/sprints">sprint on Friday</a> and mentorship is a great way to help  people new to contributing learn Drupal and, eventually, contribute back valuable time, resources, and code to the project.</p>
