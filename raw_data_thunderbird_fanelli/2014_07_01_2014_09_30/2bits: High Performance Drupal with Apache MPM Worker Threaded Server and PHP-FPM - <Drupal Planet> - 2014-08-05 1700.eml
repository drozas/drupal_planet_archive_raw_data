    In a previous article from over 5 years ago, we advocated the use of Apache MPM Worker Threaded Server with fcgid over Apache&#039;s mod_php.
That was for serveral reasons, including faster handling of static files by Apache threaded server, and lower memory utilization since PHP is not embedded in every Apache process.
However, there were some drawbacks, mainly that APC opcache cache is not shared, and each process has to have its own copy.
