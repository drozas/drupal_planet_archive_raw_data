              <p>Today, my cover was blown.</p>
<p>If you came across this photo on your Facebook account or Twitter feed and you’ve been wondering – or furiously texting friends who were in Austin last month – “Is that really...?” or “Was he...” and “Did you meet him?”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LevelTen/status/474556578738089984/photo/1"><img src="/sites/default/files/twitter-medium1.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Twitter image 1" /></a></p>
<p>The answer is:</p>
<p>No. Howard Stern did not attend DrupalCon as a Drupal Watchdog secret agent. (Although we did hear a rumor that he was in Austin at the time, taping an episode of America’s Got Talent, and that he just might put in a surprise appearance at the Convention Center.)</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chazchumley/status/473898111300300800/photo/1"><img src="/sites/default/files/twitter-small2.png" class="img-thumbnail right-border" alt="Twitter image 2" /></a>In fact, I can say with some certainty – having been a guest on his show – that Howard wouldn’t know Drupal from poopal.</p>
<p>Truly, that was I in the photo: Ronnie Ray, your fearless Watchdog blogster.</p>
<p>So now you know. But kindly keep this information on the QT.  </p>
<p>Although if you or your company want a Howardish presence at DrupalCon Amsterdam, feel free to send checks, cash, a NYC-Amsterdam round-trip airline ticket (and Howard only flies first class, alas) to R. Brawer, c/o this magazine.</p>
