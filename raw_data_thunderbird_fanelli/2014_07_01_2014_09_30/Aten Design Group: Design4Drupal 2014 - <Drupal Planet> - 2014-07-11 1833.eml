This year, along with being the Design Partner for the event, members of Aten's Design &amp; UX team will be presenting four different sessions.</p>

<p>This year's Design4Drupal (August 1-3) has been structured to give each day a specific focus. Friday kicks things off with a business summit, Saturday is chock full of sessions and Sunday wraps things up with sprints and trainings. Make sure you catch as many of Aten's sessions on Saturday as you can:</p>

<h2>Saturday, August 2, 10:15am</h2>

<h3><a href="http://boston2014.design4drupal.org/session/enhancing-design-adaptive-content">Enhancing Design with Adaptive Content</a></h3>

<p>Aten’s <a href="http://atendesigngroup.com/about/joel-steidl">Joel Steidl</a>, Lead Architect, and <a href="http://atendesigngroup.com/about/chris-coughlan">Christine Coughlan</a>, Information Architect, will share practical tips for breaking down and organizing content for projects of any size. They’ll share case studies to reinforce the theory and practice behind adaptive content and best practices for implementing it in Drupal and other platforms.</p>

<h3><a href="http://boston2014.design4drupal.org/session/layout-design-patterns">Layout Design Patterns</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://atendesigngroup.com/about/john-ferris">John Ferris</a>, Aten's Lead Front-end Developer, presents reusable solutions to common layout problems. He'll begin with foundation CSS layout concepts and then build up to specific techniques for implementing complex layouts in Drupal.</p>

<h2>Saturday, August 2, 2:15pm</h2>

<h3><a href="http://boston2014.design4drupal.org/session/anti-handoff-better-design-front-end-relationship">Anti-Handoff: A better design &amp; front-end relationship</a></h3>

<p>Front-end Developers delivering on what's promised by Designers can make or break a project. <a href="http://atendesigngroup.com/about/erin-holloway">Erin Holloway</a>, Aten's Senior Designer, will walk through approaching this problem with clear communication, the right tools and mutual respect. If you're struggling with collaboration between your team members, this session can help.</p>

<h2>Saturday, August 2, 3:30pm</h2>

<h3><a href="http://boston2014.design4drupal.org/session/giving-and-getting-great-feedback">Giving and Getting Great Feedback</a></h3>

<p>Great feedback can be the lifeblood of a successful project. However, setting aside personal preference and giving objective feedback can be challenging. Responding to that feedback can be even harder. Aten’s Designer, <a href="http://atendesigngroup.com/about/roxy-koranda">Roxy Koranda</a>, will give you the tools to both give and get great feedback.</p>

<p>With just 3 weeks until the event, there isn't a ton of time left to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/design-4-drupal-boston-2014-dc-2716-tickets-8093037493">register</a>. If you use Drupal and want to learn more about how best to approach Design, UX and Front-end Development, Design4Drupal is the place to be. We hope to see you there!</p>
