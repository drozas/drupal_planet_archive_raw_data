I've not made any blog posts in over a year and a half due to the site where my blog was before, drupaler.co.uk, closing down. And while it took me some time to get round to writing a Migrate script to import my posts from the old site's database, it was actually getting round to setting up this new domain that took the longest.</p>
<p>So what have I been doing all this time? Especially as I still don't have a single Drupal 7 site out there to my name? Well, these days I work on a humongous web application which has kept me busy for the last 18 months; it's a large Drupal site (we hit a million of one of its several custom entity types recently), but to the general public it's just a login page. I may talk more about the development challenges in future posts. </p>
<p>Prior to that, I was building what would have been one of the earliest big Drupal Commerce sites to launch... except that very shortly before launch in October 2012, the whole project got canned.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"><div class="field-label">Tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" rel="dc:subject"><a href="/taxonomy/term/52" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">contributing code</a></div><div class="field-item odd" rel="dc:subject"><a href="/taxonomy/term/41" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">drupal commerce</a></div><div class="field-item even" rel="dc:subject"><a href="/taxonomy/term/3" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">development</a></div><div class="field-item odd" rel="dc:subject"><a href="/taxonomy/term/53" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">maintaining projects</a></div></div></div>
