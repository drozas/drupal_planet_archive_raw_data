    <div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p>Lightning talks are already a crowd favorite at other conferences and camps (think O'Reilly's Ignite!), so your DrupalCon track chairs have decided to bring them to DrupalCon Amsterdam! </p>
<p>Drupal powers the best in the web, and what better way to showcase how far we've come with Drupal than during DrupalCon, bright and early on Thursday morning? That's right, this special event will be taking the place of our Thursday Keynote.</p>
<h3>What are lightning talks?</h3>
<p>Lightning talks are 5 minute presentations about anything you think would be of interest to the DrupalCon audience and can be Drupal-specific OR web-based. Here are just some ideas:</p>
<ul><li>Why I really love X module
</li><li>Cool web tools I use every day
</li><li>I really need X, and I've build a module for it
</li><li>Did you know that you can do X with Y (Module, Theme, PHP, ...)?
</li><li>The biggest fails of my projects in the last year
</li><li>This technique I use is the best, and here's why
</li><li>Don't use this technique, and here's why
</li></ul><p>These talks are short and not meant to be micro-sessions with a lot of slides and details. These talks should be stripped down to the basic points, the really spectacular bits, as you've only got 5 minutes to present. Keep it interesting and keep it short - the clock will be ticking!</p>
<h3>I want to give a lightning talk</h3>
<p>Interested in giving a lightning talk? Awesome. We suggest reading the following articles which outline what a great talk encompasses:</p>
