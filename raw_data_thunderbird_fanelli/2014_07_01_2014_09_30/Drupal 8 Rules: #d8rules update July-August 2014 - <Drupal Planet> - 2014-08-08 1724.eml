    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Since our last update, May 2014, the #d8rules initiative was able to complete funding for <a href="http://d8rules.org/content/milestone-1-drupal-8-core-integration-rules-core-engine">Milestone 1</a> and has made major development progress with two unstable releases and loads of commits on our GitHub repository.</p><p>Thanks to 142 great supports, we were able to raise&nbsp;$ 15k&nbsp;on Drupalfund. In addition to that, <a href="http://d8rules.org/content/technocrat">Technocrat</a> stepped in with buying our second largest sponsor package "<a href="http://d8rules.org/supporters/#reusable-component-providers">Reusable component providers</a>" which helps us cover 100 hours of Rules 8.x development. All in all, we are excited to say that <a href="http://d8rules.org/content/milestone-1-drupal-8-core-integration-rules-core-engine">Milestone 1</a> is now fully funded thanks to the <a href="https://www.drupalfund.us/project/d8rules-support-rules-module-drupal-8">crowd funding</a> and <a href="http://d8rules.org/supporters">10 companies sponsoring</a> #d8rules.</p><p>If you are interested in more background on the #d8rules Drupalfund campaign, make sure to <a href="http://mogdesign.eu/blog/d8rules-as-a-proof-that-drupal-community-is-a-living-cell">Virginia's blog post with all the details</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>#d8rules Rulers &amp; invoices info</h2><p>As promised, everybody who has donated $65+ on the Drupalfund will get one of the fancy Rulers provided by Nico from Ausgetrock.net! We just finished production &amp; packaging and will send them out by the next week!</p><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/MQuvA2wgqDE/embed/simple" width="320" height="320" frameborder="0"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Development update</h2><p>Development has mainly focused on working with Drupal's context system. Rules actions and conditions need parameters (for example a node object), which is represented as plugin context as used in Drupal core. They also need to provide variables (for example an entity load action will provide the loaded node object), which is implemented as provided plugin context in Rules itself. Provided context might be interesting for other Drupal 8 modules as well, so this might be moved out of Rules either into Drupal core or a Ctools-like project in D8 contributed space.</p><p>Currently we try to figure out all parts of the Rules core engine, how context is passed around and how data selectors&nbsp;are applied (example: node:uid:entity:mail:value to access the email adress of a node author). We implemented prototypes of those system parts, but the API is still experimental and we expect to change and improve things here a lot.</p><p>A number of action and condition plugins have been ported from Drupal 7 with the help of new Rules contributors, thank you to <a href="https://github.com/fubhy">fubhy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/paranojik">paranojik</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jibran">jibran </a>and <a href="https://github.com/ndewhurst">ndewhurst</a>!</p><p>We are currently working towards milestone 1 of our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2245015">roadmap</a> and we are doing monthly unstable releases to keep you up to date with development progress.</p><h2>Drupalaton training &amp; sprints: Porting Actions</h2><p>After a great <a href="http://2014.drupalalpeadria.org/session/training-d8rules-getting-started-rules-8x-development-lab">training/sprint session at DrupalCamp Alpe-Adria Portoroz</a> we finished <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2269561">porting most of the conditions</a>. This weekend, <a href="http://2014.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-21">at Drupalaton we just delivered our second training session</a> to get contributors up to speed with Rules in Drupal 8. Topics delivered include our git pull request workflow and the new and shiny things about Drupal 8 including the plug-in system, CMI and many more.</p><p><img alt="d8rules drupalaton training" height="240" width="240" class="panopoly-image-quarter media-element file-teaser panopoly-image-quarter" src="http://d8rules.org/files/styles/panopoly_image_quarter/public/2-2014-08-07%2016.51.10.jpg?itok=ajjuU1iO" title="" /></p><p><img alt="d8rules drupalaton training" height="178" width="240" class="panopoly-image-quarter media-element file-teaser panopoly-image-quarter" src="http://d8rules.org/files/styles/panopoly_image_quarter/public/1-2014-08-07%2015.21.07.jpg?itok=5s9gG3Zc" title="" /></p><div style="clear: left;"></div><div style="clear: left;">Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2269577">[META] Port all actions to 8.x</a>&nbsp;to find out about the current status of actions being ported.
