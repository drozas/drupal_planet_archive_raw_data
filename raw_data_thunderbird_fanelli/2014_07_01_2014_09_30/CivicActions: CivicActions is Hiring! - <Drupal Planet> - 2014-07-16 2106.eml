    <p>10 years ago we set out to create a company like no other.</p>
<p>Our vision was that team members could work from anywhere, collaborate with brilliant people, build cutting edge technology for the greatest civic institutions on the planet, and have a strong sense of purpose. We have exceeded all our expectations and our success is enabling us to scale even more!</p>
<p>We truly believe that <em>the way</em> we do business is as important as the product we create. We're looking to add new team members who also value quality, diversity, flexibility, healthy work/life balance, humor and supporting one another. Working for CivicActions is more than just a job - it's working with a team of people who are committed to transforming the world. </p>
<p>We believe that the best team is made from those that love what they do. </p>
<p><span>If this sounds like a dream work environment, we encourage you to reach out and share your vision with us, and explore how we can make it a reality together.</span></p>
<p>Currently we are looking candidates to fill the following roles:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.civicactions.com/careers/senior-engineer">Senior Engineer / Tech Lead / Drupal Architect</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.civicactions.com/careers/drupal-developer-themer">Drupal Site Builder / Developer / Themer </a></p>
<p>If you're full of positive energy, desire a strong sense of community, looking for meaning and significance in your work, and crave opportunities to do what you do best, <a href="/careers">we'd love to talk</a>!</p>
