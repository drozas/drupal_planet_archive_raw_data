<p>Over the Holiday weekend, over 25 tickets were solved coming out of the Alpha6 and Beta1 release of COD. Late Monday night, COD Beta2 was released! This release includes fixes to the session submission system, specifically where time-slots and tracks weren't being properly saved in some conditions. We also made changes to the administration menu paths to de-couple them from the node and be less confusing. You can see the full release notes here: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2299327">https://www.drupal.org/node/2299327</a></p></div>
