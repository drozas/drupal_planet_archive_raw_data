    <p>My first day of DrupalCon Amsterdam comes to an end, and behind me are a visit to the wonderful <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/427578">sprint</a> venue <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Berlage+meet+and+workspace,+inspired+by+seats2meet.com/@52.375386,4.897315,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c609b86f2d04b7:0xabb7cc94247cb972">Berlage</a>, which is located near the train station in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Berlage+meet+and+workspace,+inspired+by+seats2meet.com/@52.375386,4.897315,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c609b86f2d04b7:0xabb7cc94247cb972">center of Amsterdam</a>, and a loooong walk to Vondelpark (no, not Wunderkraut-sponsored <em>Wunderpark</em>, which many suggested). My global aim for this DrupalCon is to dive into the code of Drupal, becoming more custom to the code behind Drupal. Normally I classify me as a Drupal <em>user</em>, I use modules and tune them to make Drupal do the stuff I want Drupal to do. But I want to evolve, to learn something more than just <em>using</em> Drupal. So when my co-workers are going home on Thursday, I will stay for the sprints on Friday and Saturday to hopefully learn something about coding for Drupal.</p>
<p>My visit to Berlage was a small step in that direction, to see if I can help out and learn something. It turns out I came just when people were leaving to welcome the people coming to DrupalCamp Amsterdam by bike (!). I knew some of these people, so naturally I came along to Vondelpark to welcome the cyclists. A barbecue was firing up, beers were cooling and people were nice to talk to. I met a whole bunch of new people, and some old acquaintances as well (which was surprising since I don't consider myself a Drupal-globetrotter). </p>
<p>The local Drupal Community really showed off a good time, arranging this barbecue, and they also talked about what will happen during the following couple of days, which really looks promising. There are around 15 persons in the local community, and it seems they have done a good job! It's going to be nice seeing what will become of this.</p>
