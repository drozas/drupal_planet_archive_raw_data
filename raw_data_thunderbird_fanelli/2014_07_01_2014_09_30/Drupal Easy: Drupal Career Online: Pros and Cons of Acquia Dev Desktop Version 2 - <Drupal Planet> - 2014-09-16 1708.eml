<p>Since we started our long-form Drupal Career Starter Program in 2011, we've always struggled a bit trying to find a single local Apache-MySql-PHP stack that is powerful enough for day-to-day Drupal development, easy to set up, and that works for a wide range of people new to local web development.</p>
<p>We're always on the lookout for a local Drupal development stack that will help to reinforce the lessons and best practices that we strive to instill in all of our students. It's pointless to teach students methods and processes that aren't typically found in the community, so being able to bring students up-to-speed as quickly as possible with things like Drush, Git, and commonly-used workflows is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Generally, we've stuck with a combination of <a href="https://docs.acquia.com/dev-desktop">Acquia Dev Desktop (version 1)</a>, <a href="http://www.uniformserver.com">Uniform Server</a>, and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/drupalpro">DrupalPro</a>, depending on each student's skill level and previous experience.</p>
<p>Until recently, we've always had more Windows users than Mac or Linux users (combined!), and usually didn't run into any problems until we introduced Drush, Git, and other Linux-y command line tools, at which point Mac and Linux users spent a lot of time attempting to help Windows users get Drush installed.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://docs.acquia.com/dev-desktop2">Acquia Dev Desktop 2</a> was made available, the list of features definitely piqued our interest. Integration with Acquia Cloud is nice (similar to what <a href="http://www.kalamuna.com/products/kalabox">Kalabox</a> does for Pantheon), but what we were really excited about was the Drush integration.</p>
<p>Since we are using Acquia Dev Desktop 2 for the first time with our 2014 Fall Drupal Career Online program, we thought it would make sense to run through the pros and cons from a training perspective.</p>
