    <title>Drupal core announcements: This Month in Drupal Documentation</title>
    <base href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/436958">

  <body id="msgFeedSummaryBody" selected="false">
    <p>Here's an update from the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">Documentation Working Group (DocWG)</a> on what has been happening in Drupal Documentation in the last month or so. Sorry... because this is posted in the Core group as well as Documentation, comments are disabled.</p>
<p>If you have comments or suggestions, please see the DocWG home page for how to contact us. Thanks!</p>
<h3>Thanks for contributing!</h3>
<p>Since July 1st (<a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/431208">our previous TMIDD post</a>), 260 contributors have made 800 total Drupal.org documentation page revisions, including 5 people that made more than 20 edits (gisle, lolandese, YesCT, adellefrank, and mparker17) -- thanks everyone!</p>
<p>In addition, there were many many commits to Drupal Core and contributed projects that improved documentation -- these are hard to count, because many commits combine code and documentation -- but they are greatly appreciated too!</p>
<h3>Documentation Priorities</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/priorities">Current documentation priorities page</a> is always a good place to look to figure out what to work on, and has been updated recently.</p>
<p>If you're new to contributing to documentation, these projects may seem a bit overwhelming -- so why not try out a <a href="https://drupal.org/contributor-tasks/writers">New contributor task</a> to get started?</p>

<h3>Report from the Working Group</h3>
<ul>
<li>We finally finished our deliberations, and decided on our priorities for documentation-related software/infrastructure. These priorities were submitted to the Software Working Group, and are also listed on <a href="https://www.drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals" title="https://www.drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals">https://www.drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals</a>. Ideas we considered but decided were not priorities for the next year are listed on <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2258139" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/2258139">https://www.drupal.org/node/2258139</a>.</li>
<li>We are preparing for the sprints at <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/sprints">DrupalCon Amsterdam</a> (29 Sept.-3 Oct.) by updating and prioritising documentation issues. We'll be using documentation issue tag "docsprint" to tag issues that we think will be good for sprints, over the next two months especially.</li>
<li>After an initial period of setting ourselves up, we are now happy to open up the monthly meeting of the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">Documentation Working Group</a> to anyone who would like to attend. Please contact Boris (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/22175">batigolix</a>) if you want to join the meeting and send hit the email address you use for Google, since we meet in Google Hangout.</li>
