This year&rsquo;s theme for the camp is &ldquo;Large Scale Drupal&rdquo; where the focus is on how &nbsp;larger organizations can become more collaborative with the Drupal community by pooling ideas and resources together to solve common issues they are facing. There will be a wide variety sessions this year, six of which will be presented by members of NEWMEDIA.

<h3>Drupal 8 Module Development: Just the Basics</h3>

Brandon is an advocate for learning and change and in the technological world we experience that invariably. While Drupal 7 will be the best option for the short-term, it is never too early to dive in to D8 as he describes in <a href="http://www.newmediadenver.com/blog/i-love-d8">why I&nbsp;love D8!</a></p>

<h3>Integration Testing with KitchenCI &amp; Multiple Provisioners</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Works on my machine&rdquo; is no longer an acceptable reason for a Drupal site to not perform as expected across multiple environment (i.e. production, staging, development, and local development). This is particularly important as projects become larger, more complex, and have stringent requirements on performance, uptime, and security. <a href="http://www.newmediadenver.com/user/cyberswat">Kevin Bridge&#39;s</a> <a href="https://2014.drupalcampcolorado.org/session/integration-testing-kitchenci-multiple-provisioners">presentation</a> will start with the basics of &ldquo;Infrastructure as Code&rdquo; and then quickly ramp up to review how to use provisioning tools and integration tests to ensure your infrastructure is achieving the desired state.</p>
