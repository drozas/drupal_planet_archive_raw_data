    <p>Today, we are very excited to announce the latest release of our Drupal 8 theme <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/prius" target="_blank">Prius</a>. Alongside a full support ofÂ <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2341513" target="_blank">Drupal 8 Alpha 15</a>, we have included a number of new features. This release is particularly exciting as we are one step closer to an official launch of Drupal 8. Indeed, Drupal Alpha 15 is the first candidate for a <strong>Beta release</strong>. Meaning if no new beta blocker bugs are found within the next coming days<a class="anchor" href="#first_anchor"><sup>1</sup></a>, we could see the <strong>first Beta version of our favourite "CMS" very soon.</strong></p>
