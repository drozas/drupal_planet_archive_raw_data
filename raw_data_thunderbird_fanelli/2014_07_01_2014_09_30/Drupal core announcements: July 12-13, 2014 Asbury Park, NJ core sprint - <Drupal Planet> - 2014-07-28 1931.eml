    <p>On the weekend of July 12-13, 2014 the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Central-NJ-Drupal-Group/" target="_blank">Central NJ Drupal Group</a> held a core sprint focusing on the upcoming release of Drupal 8. The sprint was attended a great group of Drupal enthusiasts from Chicago,  Montreal, New York, Virginia, and of course New Jersey. We took over the Cowerks coworking space in Asbury Park, NJ for the two days and it provided us a fun space to work the day and night away on a variety of issues.</p>
<p>With only seven beta blockers remaining at the time of our sprint, two were on the top of our list of items to work on.  Fifteen people participated in person, and the group made progress on two beta blockers (leading to core commits) as well as many other issues.</p>
