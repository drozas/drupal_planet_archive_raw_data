    <p>The monthly Drupal core bug fix release window is scheduled for this Wednesday. However, there have been three releases (security releases as well as bug fix releases) in the last month and a half, and not as many changes have been committed to the development version since then as would normally warrant yet another new release.</p>
<p>A Drupal 7 bug fix release during the October release window is likely instead.</p>
<p>Upcoming release windows include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, September 17 (security release window)</li>
<li>Wednesday, October 1 (bug fix release window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on Drupal core release windows, see the documentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info#when">release timing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173280">security releases</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/260803">discussion</a> that led to this policy being implemented.</p>
