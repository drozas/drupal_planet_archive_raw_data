This approach is doomed to fail for two reasons:</p>
<ul><li>Without a precise specification of requirements, agencies will have to base their quotes entirely on guesses.</li>
<li>The client is missing out on the value that the agency could have added if they were involved in the discovery and planning as well.</li>
