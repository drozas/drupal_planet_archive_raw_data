    <p>Last Friday, we published the start to our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/brianaltenhofel/2316589">OPCache module for Drupal</a>. While it's still lacking a few features to be ready for a tagged release, we thought it'd be a good idea to get some working code out there.</p><p>The goal for this module is to allow Drupal site administrators to clear their opcode cache if they are using the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php">PHP OPcache extension</a> (also known as Zend OPcache or Zend Optimizer+) as well as provide an interface similar to the Memcache Admin module.</p><p>As of right now, the only implemented feature is cache flushing. We understand that you might be running on multiple webservers (we build a lot of sites that run on multiple webservers), so we included the ability to flush caches on all of your webservers at once.</p><p>Go try the module and feel free to submit patches!</p>
