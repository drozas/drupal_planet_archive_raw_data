<h4>The momentum behind Drupal 8 is growing, and Deeson Online have been playing their part...</h4>
<p>We in the Drupal community probably know something about Drupal 8 – even if it's just that we're aware it's coming!</p>
<p>But how do you clearly and simply highlight the benefits of Drupal 8 to a non-developer audience, or those beyond our community?</p>
<p>How can you then potentially create a non-dev community of Drupal 8 advocates and share good practice?</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0">Introducing Drupal 8 personas</a></h4>
<h5>What is a persona?</h5>
<p>A persona is a ‘person' that represents a specific group of users.</p>
<p>Organisations and companies can use intel from personas to create, for example,  a piece or pieces of content that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight expectations and use of your site for your  end user</li>
<li>Help drive the benefits in  a way that will be immediately understood  by the audience</li>
</ul>
<p>Deeson Online have been working of a series of personas to help clearly articulate the benefits of Drupal 8.</p>
<h5> How did we create Drupal 8 personas?</h5>
<p>Using interviews with a range of Drupal and non-Drupal users, we got to grips with all the pain points for a range of potential Drupal 8 users. Using <a href="https://prague2013.drupal.org/keynote/dries-buytaert">Dries Buytaert’s personas from his DrupalCon Prague Keynote speech</a> as a starting point, we then focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0/cios">CIOs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0/developers">Developers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0/sitebuilders">Sitebuilders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0/marketers">Marketers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0/content-admins">Content administrators</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0/themers">Themers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We then carried out a series of interviews via Skype and Google Hangouts asking people from across the globe from each of these user groups over 30 questions.</p>
<p>These questions ranged from "How many people work in the company?" to "From the time you wake up to the time you go to bed, what does a day in your working life look like?"</p>
<h5>What did we do with the answers?</h5>
<p>We then analysed all the responses, reducing them down to one 'persona' per user group, ensuring that we captured the persona needs and pain, then matching them against how Drupal 8 will help.</p>
<h5>The result</h5>
<p>A range of easy to consume dowloadable infographic persona fact sheets, that established and potential users can read and share.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/uploads/d1.png" style="width: 420px; height: 251px;" /></p>
<p>The results so far have been really positive. The infographic personas are proving especially useful for those within our community to have something to refer to when talking not just about the power and benefits Drupal 8, but Drupal itself.</p>
