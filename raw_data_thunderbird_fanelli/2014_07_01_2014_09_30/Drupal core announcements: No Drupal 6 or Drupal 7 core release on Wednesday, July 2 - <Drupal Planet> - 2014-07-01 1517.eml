    <p>The monthly Drupal core bug fix release window is scheduled for this Wednesday. However, the last release was <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-7.28">two months ago</a>, and there haven't been enough changes to the development version since then to warrant a new release.</p>
<p>(Note that there will be a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/430348">Drupal 8 alpha release</a> on July 2, but Drupal 8 is still under development and therefore on a different schedule than the stable core releases.)</p>
<p>Upcoming release windows include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, July 16 (security release window)</li>
<li>Wednesday, August 6 (bug fix release window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on Drupal core release windows, see the documentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info#when">release timing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173280">security releases</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/260803">discussion</a> that led to this policy being implemented.</p>
