    <p>This year, <a href="https://2014.drupalcampcolorado.org/">Drupalcamp Colorado</a> is taking on the topic of "Large Scale Drupal" - a phrase that was popularized by <a href="http://buytaert.net/announcing-acquia-large-scale-drupal-program">Dries Buytaert</a>. We're taking that phrase and using it in a generic sense to help set a focus for our event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dogstar.org/drupal/content/drupalcamp-colorado-2014-0">Matthew Saunders</a> wrote a great overview of the camp, so if you're interested and need more convincing to come, read that. This is an update on our tracks and some great sessions that have been accepted already.</p>
<h3>Tracks and session submission requests</h3>
<p>We're taking that theme as inspiration for our sessions which will be across 4 tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business and Open Source</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Commerce</li>
<li>Design and Front End</li>
<li>Development and Site Building</li>
</ul>
<p>Today we are excited to announce the first 9 sessions that have been selected. Session Submission is still open until July 11th. We've currently got too many sessions in /Development and Site Building/ and not enough sessions in the other categories. So...if you have something to say in those other areas, please <a href="https://2014.drupalcampcolorado.org/node/add/session">submit a session</a> (note, you have to login first, and you should register too).</p>
<h3>First sessions that have been accepted:</h3>
<p>There are some sessions we know we're going to accept because they come from great presenters on popular topics that match our theme. Below are the 9 sessions we knew we could accept now.</p>

</ul>
<p>I think you could attend just these 9 sessions and really have a great weekend of Drupal content and there are going to be dozens more. If you look at the titles and the presenters I think you'll see that there's a lot of people working on interesting problems as a result of dealing with "large scale" sites built in Drupal.</p>
