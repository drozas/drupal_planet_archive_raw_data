    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>What do you get when you bring together thousands of diverse open source developers in Portland, Oregon? Great parties with delicious craft beer! But you also get Linux kernel hackers mingling with Docker devops engineers who are talking with PHP and Perl developers. Great minds from across the world learn from each other to make open source even better at OSCON, the annual open source conference.</p>
<p>This year, 16 amazing volunteers helped represent Drupal to over 4,200 open source developers at the annual OSCON trade show. At the Drupal Association booth, volunteers handed out Drupal stickers, shared how Drupal can be the solution to a broad range of web needs, and talked about the extensive contrib project ecosystem and active Drupal community. Our helpful volunteers also answered a lot of questions ranging from "What is Drupal and how much does it cost?" to "When is Drupal 8 going to be released?"</p>
<p>OSCON will return next year, July 20-24, and we'd love to have you join us to spread the joy of Drupal. To get involved with spreading the word, get in touch the Drupal Association <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/contact">via their contact form</a> or through <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Hey @DrupalAssoc! I want to get involved and volunteer at conventions like @OSCON" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
