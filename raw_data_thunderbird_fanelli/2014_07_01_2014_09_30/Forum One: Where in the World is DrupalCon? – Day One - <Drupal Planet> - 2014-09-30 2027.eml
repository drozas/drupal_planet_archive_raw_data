<p>How do you get to DrupalCon? Well, apparently you just follow the signs!</p>
<p>I’d never thought about it, but nothing makes one happier than official street signs guiding me from the hotel to the venue!</p>
<p>But even with such a welcome, I love the first day of DrupalCon, and I don&#8217;t mean trainings, community summit, or sprints, although they are important and valuable. More than all of that I love reconnecting with friends, colleagues, and collaborators.</p>
<p><a class="image-link" href="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image01.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-4346 size-medium" src="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image01-250x187.jpg" alt="Adam and Webchick" width="250" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>We discuss the state of Drupal 8, and celebrate recent accomplishments, like the acceptance of the pagination dream markup (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1912608">https://www.drupal.org/node/1912608</a>) into Drupal 8 core!</p>
<p>This particular issue is one I&#8217;ve been working on consistently since Drupal Dev Days last March, but it&#8217;s not my victory alone, seven of us worked heavily on the ticket and even more contributed in smaller chunks.</p>
<p>We talk about which sessions we&#8217;ll attend and promote our own, namely Campbell’s and my Coder vs. Themer!<br />

<p>We also discuss new challenges and next steps, and in the sprint area we collaborate and problem solve together. Forum One&#8217;s <a title="Kalpana Goel" href="http://forumone.com/staff/kalpana-goel/" target="_blank">Kalpana Goel</a> is immensely passionate about core contribution and sprinting and received a scholarship from Drupal Association to come to Amsterdam and do just that.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we talk about the after parties and the social activities. But ultimately, it’s not about the hippest new nightclub or sushi at a shi-shi restaurant, it’s about people. I vastly prefer collecting colleagues and friends old and new into a semi-spontaneous dinner group, and so that’s what we did.</p>
<p>So that’s completes my recap of Day 1 in Amsterdam. Stay tuned for more updates soon!</p>
