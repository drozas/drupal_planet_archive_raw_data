    <div>My new (awesome!) coworker Sarah recapped&nbsp;<a href="http://www.advomatic.com/blogs/sarah-german/takeaways-besides-cheese-drupalcamp-wisconsin">her experiences</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="http://drupalcampwi.com/">DrupalCampWI</a>&nbsp;the other day, so I will follow suit with my thoughts from my new favorite tech camp,&nbsp;<a href="http://boston2014.design4drupal.org/">Design4Drupal</a>, held in Boston last weekend. This camp is an intimate gathering for front-end developer and designers all experiencing the same pain points working with Drupal&nbsp;and on websites in general. On the surface, that meant things were a little less geeky and a lot more stylish, and&nbsp;digging deeper, there were many substantial, tangible lessons to take home.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<em>Home base was this magical Ghery building, the Stata Center, on the MIT campus.</em></p>
<div>The organizers of D4D made a conscious effort to gear the first day more toward business, and I relished the opportunity to think more about client communication.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I attended a great session on getting better client feedback, and you can read my favorite client communication tips <a href="http://www.advomatic.com/blogs/amanda-luker/not-getting-great-client-feedback-heres-how-you-can-help">here</a>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Another gem of the day was a detailed explanation of copyright and creative commons, and robust <a href="http://www.advomatic.com/blogs/amanda-luker/quick-guide-to-free-stuff-well-images-and-fonts-internet">list of places to get open source fonts and&nbsp;stock&nbsp;imagery</a>.</div>

<em>Capped off Friday by dinner &amp; drinks with the lovely women of <a href="http://devcollaborative.com/">DevCollab</a> and <a href="http://www.pixelsandpulp.com/">Pixels&amp;Pulp</a>. Above is <a href="http://www.cuchicuchi.cc/">Cuchi Cuchi</a>. This is without a doubt how I would decorate my house if I lived alone.</em></p>
<div>I started Day Two started a little bleary-eyed, but we jumped right into all the discussions I&#39;d been itching to have, particularly about workflow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The workflow for front-end development has skyrocketed in complexity over the last few years, and we front-end devs are&nbsp;welcoming anything we&nbsp;can do to improve the hand off from design to development and to streamline our work. You can read more about taking some of&nbsp;the headaches out of front-end work&nbsp;<a href="http://www.advomatic.com/blogs/amanda-luker/streamlining-your-design-workflow">here</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The&nbsp;<a href="http://boston2014.design4drupal.org/session/responsive-javascript">Responsive Javascript</a>&nbsp;session was a good reminder to pause every time you think about&nbsp;jumping into writing some responsive Javascript. <strong>First, s</strong><strong>top, and ask if it can be done better with CSS</strong>. Most likely, CSS will trump Javascript every time&nbsp;in terms of performance, accessibility and potential QA rabbit-holes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And check out&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Testing_media_queries">w</a><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Testing_media_queries">indow.matchMedia()</a>&nbsp;-- it&#39;s a simple way to check if you have hit different breakpoints. (Be sure to grab the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/">polyfill</a>&nbsp;for IE9 and below.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Last, but not least, was the discussion on&nbsp;<a href="http://boston2014.design4drupal.org/session/real-time-multi-device-theming-say-goodbye-refresh-button">streamlining development and testing</a>.&nbsp;We got an overview of&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/">Google&#39;s Web Starter Kit</a></strong>&nbsp;and all of it&#39;s goodies, like live reloading, synchronized browser testing, and a built-in, living style guide. And there was an audible gasp (from me) when they showed what&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">browsersync.io</a></strong>&nbsp;could do;&nbsp;all devices on the network could look at the same local site, and when you scrolled down on one device THEY WOULD ALL SCROLL DOWN. Stunning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The presentation was interesting, and the dev environment really parallels the dev environment we have home-brewed for ourselves here at Advomatic&nbsp;with a combination of Compass/Sass,&nbsp;Grunt,&nbsp;LiveReload, xip.io, and&nbsp;KSS.&nbsp;I quickly learned that there aren&#39;t many other shops doing this yet, so we couldn&#39;t talk the nitty gritty details (like&nbsp;gnarly compile times). So that conversation is to be continued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can&#39;t wait to hear next year how others are using these tools to improve their workflow.</div>
