<p>How to get more business in the door, and once you have it – <strong>how in the world to get it all done</strong>?!</p>
<p>These were some of the issues that &#8220;keep them up at night&#8221;  raised by business owners in the Drupal professional services sector at the recent DrupalCon in Austin, TX.  I’ve co-led a &#8220;Bats of a Feather&#8221;  session at DrupalCon for three years now for business owners on the key issues they face; this year we had, again, a highly engaged audience of about 40-50 business owners and leaders join. Sean Larkin of <a href="http://thinkshout.com/" target="_blank">ThinkShout</a>, a digital agency in Portland, OR, joined me in facilitating the discussion. The attendees were all from consulting / professional services firms, ranging in size from 1 to 80, with a median size of about a dozen employees.</p>
<p>We listed and clustered the topics / questions of primary interest (see picture of our flip chart notes), which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business development and lead generation – how to keep work flowing in</li>
<li>Growth and capacity – how to balance hiring with business inflow</li>
<li>Support and hosting – how to provide effective support and hosting services</li>
<li>Scaling a sales team</li>
<li>The Acquia effect – how Acquia&#8217;s presence affects Drupal agencies</li>
<li>Partnering with other firms.</li>
</ul>

<p>We homed in on the two ends of the business pipeline – how to bring in more work, and how to scale the business once you have the work. Here are a few of the highlights:</p>
<h2>Subcontracting</h2>
<p>We had a lively discussion about whether and how to work as a subcontractor to other larger firms as a way to keep busy. Some folks are happy to do “white label” work for which they do not need to do business development, while others avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Tap into the clientele and BD pipeline of a larger organization that already has a backlog.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You’ll never build your own vision of your company if you are anonymous and behind someone else, your rates will never be as good, and you might sometimes end up being the scapegoat.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at Forum One, we did not subcontract for larger firms in our early growth stages, but it has become a sizable part of our portfolio in recent years.</p>
<h2>Partnering</h2>
<p>We had good discussion about partnering among other firms – finding the businesses in your area that have similar or complementary offerings, and looking to scratch each others’ backs. The Drupal share of the total web CMS market pie is still small, so we can all pitch in with each other to make the pie even bigger.</p>
<p>Why grow?  A lot of the owners from solo or very small shops have to do everything from bringing in the business to doing the work and sending the invoices. Not to mention cleaning the bathroom before a client comes over (been there). They are eager to grow out of that stage and have help so they can focus on what they feel they are best at. But how far to grow? One of the owners spoke about his satisfaction with having a 15-person team that was cohesive, cooperative, and did great work for their clients; he said he had no aspirations to grow beyond that and have bigger headaches.  It’s great that he’s clear about his goals for the business and is on track.  Others talked about wanting to build bigger practices.</p>
<p>At Forum One, I’ve been in the thick of all these stages of growth, from a small team of three doing everything, to a multidisciplinary team of about 80. In our case, we’ve chosen to grow aggressively for three main reasons: to expand the capabilities we can offer our clients, increase the impact of our work for our clients, and offer growing career opportunities to our team.</p>
<h2>Taking big steps</h2>
<p>A few of the attendees said they are grappling with issues of when and how to take their next big step – whether it&#8217;s hiring their first staff person, signing a lease for office space, or bringing on their first operational hire (project manager, BD person, operations manager, etc.). We did not have time to talk about these issues, but I think those of us who have been through these big steps were smiling to ourselves. I know I was. Not because we know the answers – there are no easy ones. But we’ve been through it and know that those stages are part of the excitement and the challenge of building a business out of nothing!</p>
