The project had raised just over 40% of its funding goal so far. The days shortened; the pressure rose. Happiness exploded exactly two days before the finish line thanks to the rescuing amount which came just in time.</p>

They confirmed it again in the case of the ‘<a href="https://www.drupalfund.us/project/d8rules-support-rules-module-drupal-8" style="margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px; color: rgb(66, 141, 172); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">D8Rules - Support the Rules module for Drupal 8</a>’ project. Together, 138 backers funded 106% of its funding goal. It equated to 15.973 dollars. With this number, D8Rules is, for the moment, the biggest project successfully funded on<a href="https://www.drupalfund.us/" style="margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px; color: rgb(66, 141, 172); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Drupalfund.us</a>.</span></p>

In one day, funders covered 8% of the funding goal already—quite good for a start. During the first two weeks the donating line grew and then it became static. The days were flowing away and more than a half of the final amount was still missing. What happened next?!</span></p>
