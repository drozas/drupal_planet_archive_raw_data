<p>Each year Google organizes a "Mentor Summit" after Summer of Code to help summarize the positive and negative experiences in an unconference style weekend of meetings. It is an awesome event and Drupal has participated several times.</p>
<p>"<em>This year we  are holding a GSoC Reunion instead of the traditional mentor summit.   What does that mean you ask? First of all, we will be almost doubling  the size of this event and having up to 600  attendees.</em>"..."<em>Two representatives from each  successfully participating organization are invited to Google to greet,  collaborate and code. Our mission for the weekend: make the program even  better, have fun and make new friends.</em>"-Google</p>
<p>Event Details @ <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gsocmentorsummitstudentreunion/home" title="https://sites.google.com/site/gsocmentorsummitstudentreunion/home">https://sites.google.com/site/gsocmentorsummitstudentreunion/home</a></p>
<p>Who is going to attend the event and represent the Drupal community? Well...let us know if you're interested. Any student or mentor who has participated in Google Summer of Code with Drupal over the past 10 years is eligable to attend.  One of our main goals is to reward students/mentors who deserve this all inclusive trip of a life  time, but first we need to know who is actually available to attend.  Event takes place 23 - 26 October, 2014 at the San Jose Marriott and  Hilton San Jose. Please contact Slurpee (  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/91767" title="https://www.drupal.org/user/91767">https://www.drupal.org/user/91767</a> ) directly if you're interested in  attending.  Let us know about your GSoC experience and why you would be a  good person to represent Drupal. Deadline to show interest is Tuesday August 19th at 23:59 -6 UTC. Please contact Slurpe prior to deadline and provide a bit of time for org admins to review everyone's feedback.</p>
<p>Google will fund two students and/or mentor delegates that have participated in GSoC in the last 10 years from each open-source organization.  Google provides a $2200 stipend to each organization to split between the two delegates.Example, in the past a delegate from the states budgeted ~$700 and European delegate budgeted ~$1300.</p>
<p>The Reunion is a perfect chance for meeting and connecting with open-source experts from around the world and discuss about how to build the community around the software, learn from other projects and show how awesome the Drupal community is. It would be really great to showcase some of the different ways that the Drupal community use for being welcoming and encouraging to giving back to Drupal, so it would be expected to prepare a presentation for the unconference. Example topics could be "Growing Pains of a Community" or "Why is Drupal such a Welcoming Community?"</p>
<p>If you are willing to come, take into account that the Mentor Summit/Reunion program is quite absorbing because of the different activities, so if you never visited the beautiful area of San Diego before, maybe you want to come before or stay late after the Reunion for enjoying the city (extra nights and costs won't be covered by Google or Drupal in any case). Important to note that each delegate is responsible for initial travel costs and will be reimbursed after Google has paid Drupal (might take several months).</p>
<p>P.S. It is never too late to start planning for GSoC 2015!  Please ping us with your thoughts/ideas/feedback or if you want to be a mentor/student @ <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/437638" title="https://groups.drupal.org/node/437638">https://groups.drupal.org/node/437638</a></p>
