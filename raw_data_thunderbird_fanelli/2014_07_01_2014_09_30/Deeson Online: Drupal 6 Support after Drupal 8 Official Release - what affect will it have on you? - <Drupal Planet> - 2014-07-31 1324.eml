    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The first official <a href="http://deeson-online.co.uk/blog/deeson-online-create-drupal-8-personas">Drupal 8 release is coming</a>. Ok, so it might seem like it's approaching at a snails pace rather than a speeding juggernaut... but it <em>is</em> on its way. So what does this mean if you're still supporting Drupal 6 sites?</span> This post should help you identify the issues.</h5><h2 class="p2">What Drupal 6 support will be provided?</h2><p class="p2">There's quite a lot of discussion in the Drupal community at the moment about what will happen to support for Drupal 6 sites once <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0">Drupal 8 is officially released.</a></p><p class="p2">Currently Drupal core only <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/version-info" target="_blank">supports one version</a> behind the current stable release. That means that when Drupal 8 has its first stable release (8.0.0) all Drupal 6 sites will no longer have any core support - more specifically security updates.</p><p class="p2">There was an <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2136029" target="_blank">issue</a> on the D6 queue around this as well as discussions at DrupalCon Austin, which suggested that this support period should be extended to 12 months.  </p><p class="p2">Although there was quite mixed feelings about this, ultimately the security team (along with key module maintainers, and representatives of the Drupal security team’s) responded by suggesting that Drupal 6 will be <a href="https://www.drupal.org/d6-lts-support" target="_blank">supported</a> for three months after the first release of Drupal 8. </p><h2 class="p2">What does this mean for all our current Drupal 6 sites?</h2><p class="p2">Currently there are only three options available for any current Drupal 6 sites:</p><ol><li class="p1"><span class="s1">Migrate any existing Drupal 6 sites to Drupal 7 (this will still be supported until Drupal 9 is released)</span></li><li class="p1"><span class="s1">Wait until Drupal 8 is released and migrate your Drupal 6 site using ‘<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2121299" target="_blank">Migrate in Core: Drupal 6 to Drupal 8</a>'</span></li><li class="p1"><span class="s1">Cross your fingers and hope for the best once Drupal 8 is released!</span></li></ol><p class="p2"><i>Option 1</i> is the obvious choice out of these, as Drupal 7 is stable and has been around for several years now and will be supported until Drupal 9 is released.</p><p class="p2"><i>Option 2</i> will come with its own problems due to the infancy of Drupal 8 as well as contrib modules that you are currently using that haven’t got a Drupal 8 version yet. </p><p class="p2">Due to the contrib modules not currently supporting a Drupal 8 version, this could delay you migrating and having to wait beyond the three months for a module to have a Drupal 8 version.</p><p class="p2"><i>Option 3</i> is at your own risk, and there are still Drupal 5 sites out there but ultimately this will depend upon what your customers are happy to spend their money on.</p><p class="p2">According to the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal" target="_blank">usage stats</a>, there are still around 3,800 Drupal 5 sites and just under 198,000 Drupal 6 sites, so there are still many sites which will need to be migrated.</p><h2 class="p2">Why are customers resistant to migrating?</h2><p class="p2">Our customers are guided (by agencies like us) to keep their sites up-to-date with security releases for core as well as contrib modules etc.  </p><p class="p2">In situations where a core version is due to have support dropped we would normally recommend our clients to start considering planning a rebuild of their site. This rebuild would be on the latest stable release (currently Drupal 7) so that they can continue to maintain the security support. </p><p class="p2">This also makes it easier (and ultimately cheaper) for them as the community will continue supporting and maintaining contrib modules for the currently supported versions.</p><p class="p2">Often customers can be resistant to this due to the cost of needing to rebuild their site and migrate their data. This can be understandable, as “<i>if it aint broke, don’t fix it</i>”, or they simply just don’t have the available money to spend on building a new site.</p><p class="p2">At Deeson Group we currently have several sites that are still on Drupal 6, and even one on Drupal 5.</p><p class="p2">As an agency we will continue to support Drupal 6 once the official release of Drupal 8 comes out, but this will probably become more painful as time goes on: less people have experience with this version and problems arise with contrib modules which are no longer supported.</p><h2 class="p2">Our advice?</h2><p class="p2">Get prepared: Make sure that your site is running on Drupal 7 and if not, start thinking about it and planning the migration to Drupal 7 now.</p><p class="p2"> </p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-node-link field-type-ds field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/labs/drupal-6-support-after-drupal-8-official-release-what-affect-will-it-have-you">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-title field-type-ds field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="dc:title"><h2>Drupal 6 Support after Drupal 8 Official Release - what affect will it have on you?</h2></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-meta field-type-ds field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">By <a href="/category/author/mike-davis">Mike Davis</a> | 31st July 2014</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="/sites/default/files/labs/drupal678_0.png" alt="" /></div></div></div>
