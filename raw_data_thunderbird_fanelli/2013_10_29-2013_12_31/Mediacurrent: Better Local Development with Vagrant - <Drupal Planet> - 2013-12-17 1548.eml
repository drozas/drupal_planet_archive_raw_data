Although some of our developers already used Vagrant for development, most of us used (native) MAMP or native LAMP, and we routinely spent time troubleshooting problems with our local stack or site-issues that only occurred on one of our machines. Additionally, sometimes errors would appear in Production that could not be reproduced in our local environments.</p>
