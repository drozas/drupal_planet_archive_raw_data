<p>A high-performance website is like a great cup of coffee: Both are heavenly when conditions are optimal, but there are small things that can quickly turn them from an enjoyable experience into something that leaves a very bitter aftertaste. With the right tools and preparation, it's possible to create a website (or cup of joe) that can be dependable (like that first sip of coffee in the morning), fast to respond (like a quick shot of espresso), and scalable for many visitors (like that fancy cappuccino machine at Williams Sonoma, the one you casually mention to all your friends as your birthday approaches).</p>
<p>This is the first in a series of columns on the subject of “Caffeinated Drupal,” where I'll cover Drupal performance issues, always being sure to relate the topic to my favorite beverage.</p>
<p>Let's get started, shall we? Grab a steaming cup of java (or iced, if you prefer) and we’ll set out to learn about Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and how they can give a huge speed boost to your website, with minimal configuration. Not sure which coffee to choose today? I recommend a lovely Ethiopian Sidamo served as a cappuccino — nothing like that powerful fruit flavor with undertones of bittersweet chocolate — topped with a dab of perfectly-foamed milk.</p>

When not performing infrastructure magic and improving high-performance Drupal sites as part of his day job at Tag1 Consulting, you can probably find him roasting coffee, rock climbing, or watching hockey.</p>
