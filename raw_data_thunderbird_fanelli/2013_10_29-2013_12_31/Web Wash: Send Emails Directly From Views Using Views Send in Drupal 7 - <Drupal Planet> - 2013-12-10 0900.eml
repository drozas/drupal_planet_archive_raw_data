The module makes it really easy to create a views listing page where an editor can select a few rows and send out mass emails.</p>

<p>For example, if you're using <a href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce">Drupal Commerce</a> to sell a particular product you could use Views Send to update your customers on the progress of their order. Just make sure you don't spam the customer with a lot of emails.</p>

<p>A lot of what Views Send does, can be achieved using other modules like <a href="https://drupal.org/project/simplenews">Simplenews</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a> and possibly <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations">Views Bulk Operations (VBO)</a>. However, Views Send is easier to use and the module is fairly lightweight.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we'll create a page that lists Drupal users and use Views Send to send out emails.</p>
