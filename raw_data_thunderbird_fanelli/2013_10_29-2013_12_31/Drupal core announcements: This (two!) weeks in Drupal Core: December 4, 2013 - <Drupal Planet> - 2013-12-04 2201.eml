    <h2 id="new">What's new with Drupal 8?</h2>
<p>The last two weeks have been absolutely ACTION PACKED Drupal 8 core-wise. Let's see if I can remember it all. :)</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/imp">Migrate in Core team</a> had their first <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2125717">core patch land</a>! This provides the underlying architecture for migrations, as well as a variable-to-CMI migration as a proof of concept. Drupal 8 will provide migrations from Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 both. If you're curious to see how it works, read the <a href=”https://drupal.org/node/2141805”>change notice</a> for a quick overview, and the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2127611">excellent documentation</a> for more details. BIG congrats to mikeryan, chx, marvil07, bdone, jessehs, mpgeek, BTMash, fastangel, mongolito404, Moshe Weitzman, eliza411, YesCT, dawehner, and cosmicdreams!</li>
<li>Ding, dong! <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2088121">Overlay module is dead!</a> My ears are still ringing a bit from all of the cheers and applause. :P~ However, rather than the module simply being booted to /dev/null, it has instead been replaced by a nifty <a href="https://drupal.org/node/787896">"Back to site" button</a> that shows up when you're in an admin context, and takes you back to where you were on your main site:<br />
<img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/Screen Shot 2013-12-04 at 9.43.31 AM.png" alt="When on an admin page, a 'Back to site' link appears in the top left portion of the toolbar." /><br />
After <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/375153">extensive usability testing</a>, this solution was found to solve the same "lost context" problem as the Overlay, but with a few thousand fewer lines of code. :) Let us all build nod_ a statue, as well as yoroy, lisarex, and Bojhan from the UX team.</li>

<li>Alex Pott, single-handedly responsible for almost 50% of the commits in Drupal 8 since he became a core maintainer, is nearing the end of his savings account + <a href="https://www.gittip.com/alexpott/">Gittip</a> supplements that have allowed him to focus on core full time the past few months. Alex is <a href="http://alex.vit-al.com/node/16">actively seeking diverse community funding to sustain his momentum independently</a>. If you're a business excited about the new awesome things Drupal 8 will bring, this would be an excellent way to very directly support all of D8 contributors' efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2142291">drupal 8.0-alpha6</a> shipped, and <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/377783">alpha 7 is due on December 16</a>. Get your patches in now! <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=alpha+target">Here's the current hit-list.</a></li>
<li>There were also <a href="https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003">security releases</a> of Drupal 6 and 7, which <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=SA-CORE-2013-003">we are are in the process of forward-porting to Drupal 8 now</a>. If you can help here to ensure expedient patching, that would be great!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="help">Where can I help?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Performance-wise, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2073819">remove  drupal_add_css()</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2073823">remove drupal_add_js()</a>, and <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1830588">remove drupal_set_title()</a> are all very close, and fixing these helps to enable render caching, as well as get us to beta 1 sooner.</li>
<li>If you're interested in learning Drupal 8 OO best practices, the ongoing effort to <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1971384">Convert page callbacks to Controllers</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2112569">Convert non-controller forms to FormInterface</a> is still happening. Read the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1953342">docs on how to get started</a>, as well as <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2117411">Form API-specific info</a>.</li>
<li>The Accessibility team is seeking help with the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/366873">Green by 2014</a> initiaitve, which aims to ensure that there are zero accessibility-related test failures by 2014! Read that post for info on getting started.</li>
<li>If you eat HTML and CSS for breakfast, the ongoing <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/283223">Style Guide for Drupal 8's admin theme</a> effort needs helping hands. See if you can help with any of the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search?projects=&amp;status[]=Open&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=styleguide">issues tagged "styleguide"</a>.</li>
<li>As always, if you're new to contributing to core, check out <a href="https://drupal.org/core-mentoring">Core contribution mentoring hours</a>. Twice per week, you can log into IRC and helpful Drupal core mentors will get you set up with answers to any of your questions, plus provide some useful issues to work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="#help">Where can I help?</a> section for how to help push this area further!</p></li>

<li>Meanwhile, in Entity Field API-topia, lots of refactoring that helps bring these APIs closer to solid ground:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2047229">Issue #2047229 by fago, smiletrl, Berdir, effulgentsia, amateescu: Make use of classes for entity field and data definitions.</a></li>

So from now on, just say "no" to $GLOBALS! </li>
<li>Additionally, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2131851">Issue #2131851 by tim.plunkett: Form errors must be specific to a form and not a global</a> changed the signature of various form error-handling functions to now take a $form_state argument.</li>

<h2 id="planet">Drupal 8 Around the Interwebs</h2>
<p>Blog posts about Drupal 8 and how much it's going to rock your face.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vijay Nandwani and Matthew Lechleider put together a great tutorial on <a href="http://hellobrothisisfree.x10.mx/blog/node/2">how to add a user interface "tour" of your module</a> using Drupal 8's Tour module.</li>
<li>December 3 was <a href="http://www.idpwd.com.au/">International Day of People with Disabilities (IDPwD)</a>, and Dries marked the occasion with a write-up of <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-web-accessibility-to-the-core">all the ways Drupal aims to be an inclusive community and platform</a>. Jesse Beach made a sister post <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/383053">celebrating the individuals who help make our stellar accessibility possible</a>.</li>
<li>As part of their ongoing Drupal 8 Field API series, yched, swentel, and amateescu wrote an article about <a href="http://realize.be/drupal-8-field-api-series-part-4-entity-form-displays-and-display-modes">entity (form) displays and display modes</a>, which does a deep-dive into this API and the improvements it offers over Drupal 7.</li>
<li>Also in Field API land, check out Ivan Zugec's tutorial on <a href="http://webwash.net/tutorials/how-create-custom-field-formatter-drupal-8">How to Create a Custom Field Formatter in Drupal 8</a>. It demonstrates turning a regular ol' boring link field into a snazzy YouTube player embedding link field!</li>
<li>For the more design-inclined, Danny Englander wrote a great guide on <a href="http://highrockmedia.com/blog/porting-contrib-theme-drupal-8-get-twiggy-with-it">porting your theme from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 (Get Twig-gy With It)</a>. This goes over the syntax changes, file changes, and more. And best of all, it's pretty short! :)</li>
<li>Steve Burge from Open Source Training provides an overview of the major changes in Drupal 8 since September in <a href="http://www.ostraining.com/blog/drupal/drupal-8-november-2013/">The State of Drupal 8: November 2013</a>. Useful if you've missed a few installments of This Week in Core.</li>
<li>If you want a more extensive D8 deep-dive, yours truly will also be giving a <a href="https://www.acquia.com/resources/webinars/drupal-8-preview-what-expect">Webinar on Drupal 8 and what to expect</a> on Tuesday, Dec. 10. Be there or be square! ;) (but please, no heckling. :D)</li>
