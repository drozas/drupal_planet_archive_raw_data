<p>2013 has been a big year and there's so much to share that this is Part 2 in our ongoing series of highlights. (Did you miss <a href="https://drupal.la/articles/2013-year-in-review-part-1">Part 1</a>? Read that first.) </p>
<p>This post is a long one, so grab your favorite beverage (or a shawarma) and join us when you're ready. </p>
<h3>Highlights from 2013
</h3><p><strong>Drupal Job Fair &amp; Employers Summit</strong><br />
In January, 2013, Droplabs held another <a href="https://droplabs.net/events/2013/01/28/los-angeles-drupal-job-fair">Drupal job fair</a> but this time also had its first <a href="https://droplabs.net/events/2013/01/28/los-angeles-drupal-jobs-summit">Drupal Employers Summit</a>. All the companies in the area who had ever hosted a Drupal meetup or other Drupal-related event, had sponsored any of the previous job fairs, or simply asked to attend, were invited.</p>
<p>Half a dozen companies were represented, including <a href="https://drupal.la/sponsors/civicactions">CivicActions</a>, <a href="https://drupal.la/sponsors/exaltation-of-larks">Exaltation of Larks</a>, <a href="https://drupal.la/sponsors/filter-digital">Filter Digital</a>, <a href="https://drupal.la/sponsors/princess-cruises">Princess Cruises</a>, <a href="https://drupal.la/sponsors/sensis-agency">Sensis Agency</a> and <a href="https://drupal.la/sponsors/stauffer">Stauffer</a> and they talked into the night about hiring strategies and challenges, the desired skills that candidates should have for various roles, and ideas on how to grow Drupal talent.</p>
<p><strong>Relaunched as Greater Los Angeles Drupal</strong><br />
At our <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/289988">open governance meeting in April, 2013</a>, we voted to rename our group from "Downtown Los Angeles Drupal" to "Greater Los Angeles Drupal" (or just "GLAD", for short). This made sense since our organizers now endeavor to serve the 5 counties in the Greater Los Angeles Area and not only the Downtown Los Angeles region, but the name change led to some <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1951258">debate and vexation</a> from members of a nearby group.</p>
<p><strong>Governance policy enacted after a year of work</strong><br />
GLAD is founded on the values of teamwork, transparency, accountability, and the sharing of assets and resources. Work began on a formal governance policy just 6 days after <a href="https://drupal.org/comment/5958418#comment-5958418">the group was approved</a> on Drupal Groups, and grew to include <a href="https://drupal.la/about/governance#definition-of-roles">definitions of roles</a>, our own <a href="https://drupal.la/about/governance#code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a> and a procedure for <a href="https://drupal.la/about/governance#conflict-management-and-resolution">how to manage and resolve conflicts</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I know, GLAD is the first Drupal user group to draft and implement a governance policy like this that's separate from the Drupal Code of Conduct. Hopefully, this governance policy can serve as an example and help other groups decide whether if a similar policy would be a good fit for them.</p>
<p><strong>GLADCamp 2013 postponed :(</strong><br />
As with the change of name to Greater Los Angeles Drupal, not all of our highlights from 2013 went smoothly. Originally planned as a 3-day megaconference for all things Drupal, our 2013 conference was supposed to be a successor to Drupal Design Camp LA but it fell through when contracts with the venue didn't materialize. This was terribly disappointing, but provided bittersweet lessons for our organizing team.</p>
<p><strong>Module Develoment Boot Camp at Droplabs</strong><br />
In the summer, Droplabs started its free, community-led <a href="https://droplabs.net/modbootcamp">Module Development Boot Camp</a>. With 12 weeks of drills, exercises and exams, all aimed at training PHP and Drupal programmers the skills they need to write Drupal modules, this is the first event of its kind as far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>Droplabs named world’s “Top Drupal location”</strong><br />
With 62 events dedicated to Drupal, <a href="https://droplabs.net">Droplabs</a> was recognized by Drupical as the world's "<a href="https://droplabs.net/news/droplabs-recognized-as-worlds-top-drupal-location">top Drupal location</a>" between the months of July, 2012, and July, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Drupal Watchdog magazines for everyone</strong><br />
Are you an an organizer of an open source group or event in Southern California? Would you like a box of Drupal Watchdog magazines to give to your members and attendees? Droplabs announced that it had <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/310418">a very large surplus</a> of Watchdog magazines and that they're just giving them away. They're already making their way as far as San Diego for the upcoming <a href="http://www.sandcamp.org">SANDcamp</a> conference.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.onedaycareer.org">OneDayCareer.org</a> wins at Stanford</strong><br />
What started out as a barn raising to help attendees of the <a href="https://droplabs.net/modbootcamp">Module Development Boot Camp</a> get hands-on experience with custom module development, Git, Features and team-based collaboration, <a href="https://droplabs.net/news/onedaycareerorg-selected-as-top-20-project-at-stanford-university">the OneDayCareer.org team went on to win</a> at the Technology Entrepreneurship Demo Day at Stanford University, beating out 20,000 other students!</p>
<p>Again, there is simply too much to cover in one post. See you next time in the last part of our series!</p>
