    <p>In order to help module developers who are attempting to port their modules early enough in the D8 cycle to provide <a href="https://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core/d8dx">Developer Experience</a> feedback, as well as to enable accessibility and usability testing of Drupal 8 against a non-moving target, we will be issuing approximately monthly alpha releases!</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2115009">Drupal 8.0 Alpha 4</a> was released on October 18, we plan to release <strong>Alpha 5 on November 18, 2013</strong>. Use the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?sid[]=Open&amp;version[]=7234&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=alpha+target">alpha target</a> tag to view a list of important issues we're targeting to get in by that time which you can help with!</p>
