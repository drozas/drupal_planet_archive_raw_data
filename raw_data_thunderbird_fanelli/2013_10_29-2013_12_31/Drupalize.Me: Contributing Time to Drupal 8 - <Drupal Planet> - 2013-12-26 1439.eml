There is a lot of work to do and a lot to learn. We've decided to dedicate a minimum of five hours per week towards Drupal 8 for each person on the Drupalize.Me team. We are now a hefty group of eight people, and everyone will be diving in for a total of 40 hours per week dedicated to Drupal 8. (At least until Drupal 8 launches, and hopefully even beyond that.) Everyone is picking their own projects and ways to get involved. We just started dedicating this time in December, and folks have been spending time sorting out where things are and where to jump in.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-blog-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above text-secondary"><div class="field-label">Related Topics:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/taxonomy/term/31">community</a>, <a href="/taxonomy/term/60">Drupal 8</a></div></div></div>
