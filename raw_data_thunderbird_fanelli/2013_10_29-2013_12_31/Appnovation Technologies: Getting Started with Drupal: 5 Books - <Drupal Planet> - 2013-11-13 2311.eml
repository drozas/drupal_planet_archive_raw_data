I've compiled a list of 5 books that cover a wide array of topics including environment installation, taxonomy, module development, to more advanced Drupal capabilities such as database management, and security. The list includes two books that are not necessarily Drupal specific but they are valuable in providing a well-rounded development approach and will prepare you to take on your own Drupal projects.</p><ol start="1"><ol start="1"><li><a href="http://www.drupalbook.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Pro Drupal 7 Development</strong> by <em>Todd Tomlinson</em>, <em>John VanDyk</em></a></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-left: 30px;">This was the first book recommended to me when I began my journey into Drupal. Readers are introduced to the core concepts of Drupal including file structures, nodes, modules, and much more.</p><ol start="1"><ol start="2"><li><a href="http://usingdrupal.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Using Drupal</strong> by <em>Angela Byron</em>, <em>Addison Berry</em>, <em>Bruno De Bondt</em></a></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Using Drupal</em> serves as a reference guide for the popular Drupal video site: Drupalize.me. The “hands-on” portion of the book will provide instructions on implementing different types of functionality and gives readers something to work with.</p><ol start="1"><ol start="3"><li><a href="http://drupalfordesignersbook.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Drupal for Designers</strong> by <em>Dani Nordin</em></a></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Drupal for Designers</em> takes a slightly different approach than the first two. This book covers communicating the advantages of Drupal, client collaboration, implementing designs, and lightly treads on the technical side. The book is catered towards those taking on Drupal projects alone or with a small team.</p><ol start="1"><ol start="4"><li><a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/" target="_blank"><strong>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</strong> by Jon Duckett</a></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Although Jon Duckett’s book is not specifically for Drupal development, the book covers the basics for anyone new to web design or development. The layout and content are easy to digest and will provide a fundamental understanding of core concepts of web structure (HTML) and styling (CSS).</p><ol start="1"><ol start="5"><li><a href="http://sensible.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</strong> by <em>Steve Krug</em></a></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em> discusses one of the most valuable topics in web development: the users. I was introduced to this book by my professor in university and it changed the way I approach creating websites. This book places an emphasis on the user-experience and keeping things clear, concise and ultimately seamless for visitors.</p><p>Learning a new framework can be a daunting task, however with the help of these five books, the learning curve can be separated into manageable sections. If you have any recommendations of your own, please feel free to add the title and author in the comments. Happy reading!</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-blog-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Blog Tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/content-tags/drupal-0" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">drupal</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/content-tags/usability" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">usability</a></div><div class="field-item even"><a href="/content_tags/open_source" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">open-source</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/content-tags/html5" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">html5</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-section field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Section:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/section/drupal" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">Drupal</a></div></div></div>
