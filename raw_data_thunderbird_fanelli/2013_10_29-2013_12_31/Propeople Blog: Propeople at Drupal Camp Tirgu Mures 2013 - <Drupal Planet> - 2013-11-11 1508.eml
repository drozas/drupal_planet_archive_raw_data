Over 150 participants from Romania, Moldova, Great Britain, Hungary, and Belgium attended the event.</p><p>A total of 15 sessions were held during the event, 5 of them presented by <a href="http://wearepropeople.com">Propeople Drupal Agency</a> speakers:</p><h5>Formula X - Audacious Design Meets Quality Development by Alexandru Scutaru and Sergiu Savva</h5><p>The Formula X session was the only case study presented at DrupalCamp Tirgu Mures. The audience was impressed by the design, implementation, and the short period of development - 1.5 months. The session was followed by surprisingly many questions and discussions, and we were really happy to see such a high level of interest from the crowd.</p><p>I strongly believe that <a href="/clients">showcases</a> should be presented more often at DrupalCamps, as they are real life examples of how Drupal is actually performing.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="486" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/28117045" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" width="597"></iframe></p><h5>Projects Administration Interface (PAI) by Vladimir Melnic</h5><p>The topic I spoke about is for experienced developers who often to install multiple Drupal instances for testing purposes and need a solution that would help them do it a lot faster. However, I was happy to acknowledge that my presentation attracted a lot of attention from beginners also. The public was very active and questions would not stop coming. It was a really nice experience.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="486" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/28045037" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" width="597"></iframe></p><h5>Services in Drupal 8 by Andrei Jechiu</h5><p>DrupalCamp Tirgu Mures was an interesting and useful experience. It was cool especially because it was the first time I had the opportunity to have a presentation at a DrupalCamp event and also because I had the chance to find out lots of useful stuff presented by other participants.</p><p>My presentation about Services in Drupal 8 was a rather introductory one. The main goal I was trying to achieve was to create a general idea about REST services in Drupal 8 core, and present it to the audience in an understandable manner. I also tried to make a comparison between the Services module, RESTWS, Services Entity API we have now in Drupal 7 and brought some personal ideas on how should Services be in Drupal 8. Unfortunately my presentation was the only one related to Drupal 8. I was hoping to see more.</p><p>&gt;esides the event itself, I care to mention that Tirgu Mures is a very beautiful town with a gorgeous architecture. I hope to visit it again sometime soon.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="385" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/27843390" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" width="597"></iframe></p><h5>Apache Solr - Intuitive Search by Doru Furtuna</h5><p>The thing I would like to begin with is that DrupalCamp Tirgu Mures gave me the opportunity to learn new stuff, meet awesome people, and find out about useful solutions to be used in my day-by-day activity as a developer at Propeople.</p><p>Speaking about ApacheSolr in front of 150+ people was kind of emotionally challenging as this was the first time I ever held a session at a Drupal event. Despite my struggles to keep my calm, my voice was charged with emotion and I was speaking like a train. Nevertheless, my colleagues encouraged me constantly and it helped me a lot to take it to the end, successfully I would say.</p><p>I chosed to speak about ApacheSolr as a result of the experience I gathered while working on one of projects at Propeople. I learnt a lot about ApacheSolr during this project and I felt it would be a good idea to share my fresh knowledge.</p><h5>Panels Everywhere as a Concept by Sergiu Savva</h5><p>Over the time I have tried different modules that would help me create Drupal sites in a short period of time with the highest level of flexibility possible. I experimented with Context, Custom Blocks, Display Suite, Panels, Panels Everywhere. The best choice from my point of view would be a combination of Panels and Panels Everywhere. Formula X was the project that made me realize that there is no better way.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="486" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/28117101" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" width="597"></iframe></p><h5>The trip itself...</h5><p>… was awesome! We had a lot of fun, and more important than anything, new people to share ideas and knowledge with. Overall, DrupalCamp Tirgu Mures 2013 was a successfully organized <a href="/news">Drupal event</a> and saying that we didn’t like it would be lying, because we did! Actually, we liked it so much that we won’t miss the DrupalCamp Cluj 2014 for the world. See you there!</p><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://d3gda9raw7t781.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/services_full/public/tgmrs.jpg?itok=11L4saVU" alt="Drupal camp tirgu Mures 2013" title="Drupal camp tirgu Mures 2013" /></p></div></div></div><div class="form-item form-type-item">
