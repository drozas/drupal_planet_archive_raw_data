<p>If you have been using Facebook Insights heavily you would know that there are is a huge limit when you export Post Level Data (Maximum of 500), so if you use your page heavily you would have more than 500 posts a month.</p>
<p>FaceShift is a tool extract post level report (Post title, link, number of likes, comments, and shares) for each post for a selected month, for any given Facebook page whether it was yours or for a competitor, you simply select the date and the facebook page, and the report will be emailed to you (most likely to your spam folder) in an Excel downlable link.</p>
<p>Give it a try and leave me your feedback</p>
