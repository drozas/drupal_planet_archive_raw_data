<p><em>Build us a new website!</em></p>
<p>Five simple words that spark enthusiasm and excitement — and sheer panic — in the minds of those responsible for pulling off that feat. What seems like a no-brainer to those who have never built a website can easily turn into a Herculean labor — fraught with delays, deadlines, cost overruns, headaches, and compromises on the capabilities that were once envisioned through rose-colored glasses.</p>
<p>While building a new website can be a daunting job, there is fresh hope for those embarking on that journey; hope empowered by the capabilities of a web content management system (CMS) like Drupal. Although constructing a website is no simple task, it doesn’t have to be overwhelming, nor overly complex, if you take the correct approach and leverage the tools freely available to you in a CMS.</p>
