    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>I have been following progress of <a href="http://backdropcms.org/" target="_blank" title="Backdrop CMS">Backdrop CMS</a> since <a href="http://www.jenlampton.com/blog/introducing-backdrop-cms-drupal-fork" target="_blank">Jen's initial blog</a> about the Drupal fork as I feel its very interesting. I haven't made any contributions directly/indirectly to Backdrop, but I have moral support for the initiative, its always good to start some venture when you feel its right. I liked Nate and Jen's idea about having a stable Core Architecture for longer duration and instead focus on addressing issues related to the modern web development. Much like Linux systems, where Kernals are only upgraded on the need basis to address limitations rather than wholesale change in API/Architecture.</p>
<p>I got into the Drupal world since Drupal 7, so, I am not qualified to comment about how painful it was for Drupal 6 developers/users to adopt to Drupal 7, but they have point about changing API which always have additional cost involved.</p>
<p>Drupal 8 looks major revamp of the core and rightfully so. In modern web development where Users want friendly wesite to be accessible via all the devices they can use, Developers want ease of development, Designers wants design friendly tool, Server guys want less load in the server. Addressing all these issues is daunting task in itself, but I feel Drupal 8 is going towards the right direction to be an ideal web development platform addressing lots of modern web development issues with its own approach.</p>
<p>I love Perl and I am Big fan of Python, but I got into the PHP world due to its simplicity and ease of use for developing different scales of websites. When I got into PHP, I was very nostalgic about Perl and swearad alot at PHP, but PHP itself have changed from loosly typed syntax included in HTML directly, to an emerging candidate to take over as one of the Greatest Programming Platform. This is positive change and we should celebrate its development. Web Development in PHP without Object Oriented principles, flexible design patterns, DRY concept are of yesteryears, so, instead of being Nostalgic we need to move on and embrace the change. </p>
<p>I have nothing against Backdrop, if they make it to the release, I will be happy, as I will get Upgraded Drupal 7 to use (if it'd be fully compatible with Drupal 7 and its Modules), but I feel they did bit hurry to fork Drupal. I'd love if the fork was based on Drupal 8 core addressing major issues in Drupal core. Something like Pressflow's fork of Drupal 6 which addressed slowness in Drupal sites.<span style="line-height: 1.538em;"><br /></span></p>
<p>I hope Drupal 8's Architecure would be the stable release for lots of coming years and developers would focus more on making Drupal more ease to develop/use. Looking at the stats of <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/08/state-of-the-word/" target="_blank">Wordpress powering 20% of the entire web</a> and Drupal sharing only 2% should be taken as good lesson to focus for ease of use, developer friendly, business platform friendly, etc.</p>
<p>It might be lots of Drupalers are not happy with Drupal 8, so, I am eagerly waiting for the Drupal fork based on Drupal 8 (might happen someday). If this happens then I will give my full moral support for the one who starts it, positive changes and competitions would make the web better. </p>
