Some were new to contributing and some experts. The event was a 2 day event, we started sprinting in a small hall on 9th November with about 10 members all trying to have their git set up, working in downloading <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/8" target="_blank">Drupal 8</a>. On Day 2 we moved on to more live action worked from about 10:30 AM till about 3:00PM all so engrossed on working on the core Drupal issues!</p>
