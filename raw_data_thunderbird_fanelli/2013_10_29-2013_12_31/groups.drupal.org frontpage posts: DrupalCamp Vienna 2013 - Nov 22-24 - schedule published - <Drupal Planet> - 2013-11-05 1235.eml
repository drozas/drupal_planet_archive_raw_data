    <p>Dear Drupalistas from all over Europe and beyond!</p>
<p>It's official - the schedule for DrupalCamp Vienna 2013 is now online:<br />
<a href="http://2013.drupalcamp.at/schedule" title="http://2013.drupalcamp.at/schedule">http://2013.drupalcamp.at/schedule</a></p>
<p>We were pretty stunned by the fact that you folks submitted an awesome amount of 60 sessions. Selecting sessions always means that you have to draw a line at some point, but I really think that we were able to put together an outstanding line-up of Drupal and non-Drupal talks for this conference.</p>
<h2>Keynotes anyone?</h2>
<p>This is really exciting for us! Jeffrey aka. Jam McGuire from Acquia will kick-off the camp with his Friday keynote "<a href="http://2013.drupalcamp.at/session/connecting-open-minds">Connecting Open Minds</a>" that very much reflects our conference theme: connect with relevant experts from within and outside of the Drupal community.</p>
<p>Equally exciting, but from a totally different angle, John O'Nolan, founder of the Ghost project keynotes the second day of DrupalCamp Vienna: "<a href="http://2013.drupalcamp.at/session/focus-value-choosing-just-one-thing-bazaar">Focus: The Value of Choosing Just One Thing at The Bazaar</a>" is about the value of not diversifying, but doing just one thing - and doing it really, really well.</p>

</p>
<h2>Give me some content!</h2>
<p>We have plenty of it. There are 2 keynotes, 36 sessions in four tracks and a closing session with 9 featured speakers and don't forget about a specific track for BoFs plus an all-day coding lounge!</p>
<p>Which topics are being covered? 10 sessions are on coding &amp; development, 9 sessions about front-end &amp; design, 9 sessions on site building, 6 business sessions and both 1 session on content strategy as well as user groups &amp; community.</p>
<h2>Last chance to get your early bird tickets...</h2>

<h2>Let's not forget about the trainings!</h2>
<p>We'd also like to invite you again to check out our pre-conference trainings. Don't miss this unique opportunity to learn the Symfony framework directly from the Sensio Labs CTO Freerich Bäthge and learn from Drupal experts such as: Gábor Hojtsy, the Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative lead, Wolfgang Ziegler, creator of the Entity API and the Rules module or Sebastian Siemssen, the Omega 4.x maintainer. And finally, Jürgen Mayrbäurl from Microsoft offers a training to run Drupal on Windows Azure.<br />
