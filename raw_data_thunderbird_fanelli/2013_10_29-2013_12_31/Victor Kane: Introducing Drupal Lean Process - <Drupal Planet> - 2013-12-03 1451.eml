<h2 class="western"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have been working in software development a long time. Early on I recognized the need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">Process</a> as a way of re-using best practices for teamwork. At that time, Process implied for most of us the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Waterfall_model">Waterfall model</a>, which divides a development project into discipline based phases, each to be visited once in turn, in a kind of cascade: Requirements; capture the requirements, do the Design, Implementation, Verification and Validation, Deploy, then shift into Maintenance mode. Most people still follow that model implicitly, it has stayed in the everyday consciousness of process, much like Newton's laws instead of the Theory of Relativity, much like the reactionary and sinister theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">Creationism</a> over the scientific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_evolution">Theory of Evolution</a> kicked off by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. But project difficulties and even failures based on the extremely high propensity (40% minimum) for requirements to change within the life-cycle of a project moved me to recognize the necessity for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Iterative_and_incremental_development">Iterative and Incremental</a> model. And when that became too top-heavy, at least in its wonderful, eye-opening but hard to tailor and work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process">Rational Unified Process</a>, I moved on to a kind of personal synthesis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMMI">CMMI</a> (love that continuous improvement and organization wide adoption!) and <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Agile and Scrum</a> approaches. More recently I have loved the simpler work in process and visual approach of the Kanban as a lean variety of Agile:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some Agile methods take a more flexible approach to time than Scrum does. (For example, Kanban does away with the notion of a two-week batch of work and places the emphasis on single-piece flow.) But you can still make time within a Scrum sprint in which creative activities can take place.” Gothelf, Jeff (2013-02-22). <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do">Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience</a>.
