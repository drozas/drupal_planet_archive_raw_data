The general mantra was "I'm not using it until module X has a D7 release." “Module X” was typically <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>, which is no longer an issue now that it's in core. Therefore, I’d like to help alleviate that issue by focusing on upgrading the contrib space now, before Drupal 8 gets released.</p>
