Traditionally, Intranets have been built on proprietary platforms such as Sharepoint or Jive. But open source Drupal is becoming an increasingly popular and more viable option. Compared to costly proprietary platform licensing fees that are typically based on number of users, the cost of running a Drupal Intranet is significantly less than proprietary platforms.</p>
