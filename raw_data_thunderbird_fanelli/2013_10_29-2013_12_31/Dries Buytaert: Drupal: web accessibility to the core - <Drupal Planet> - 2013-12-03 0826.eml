Drupal is an inclusive community, both in how we interact with each other and in the results of our work.</p>
<p>We understand the need to create software that is accessible, both for consumption and production of content.  Our <a href="//drupal.org/about/accessibility”">accessibility statement</a> opens by saying:</p>
<p><em>As an inclusive community, we are committed to making sure that Drupal is an accessible tool for building websites that can also be accessed by people with disabilities.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://drupal.org/user/112345">Donna Benjamin</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/user/748566">Jesse Beach</a> wrote a great overview of the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/383053">accessibility improvements efforts in Drupal 8</a>.  It will meet higher standards of access than our previous releases.  As developers and site builders, we continue to incorporate new techniques and access technologies into Drupal. Accessibility to the core.</p>
<p>As a community, we're proud and thankful for the efforts of all those who have contributed time and energy writing, reviewing and testing patches aimed at improving the accessibility of Drupal.  There is much work still to do.  If you are able, please <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/accessibility">join the accessibility effort</a> to make sure our next version is our best yet. <em>Thank you!</em></p>
