But when I first joined Appnovation, Drupal – the CMS we use – was very new to me. To learn more about this specific CMS, I took a top-down approach, wanting to first capture a big-picture of Drupal; I posed a list of questions:</p><ol><li>What is the overall organization of Drupal?</li><li>Why is Drupal the application of choice when it comes to selecting a CMS?</li><li>Who uses Drupal as their CMS? And what do they have to say about it?</li><li>What does Drupal offer that can fulfill the needs of our clients?</li><li>What is the size of the Drupal community and how far is its global reach?</li><li>As a Business Analyst, what are the need-to-know items regarding Drupal?</li></ol><p>I visited the <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal website</a>, reviewed documents, and had in-depth discussions with our Development team.  I wanted more, so to capture a larger spectrum of information to help answer my questions above, I also searched out videos. Here is my list of 10 most useful Drupal videos:</p><p>These 3 offer a good overview of Drupal using different approaches:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/18352872">“Drupal 7 Marketing Video”</a></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Drupal CMS Video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26_OZeBmpXs&amp;feature=youtu.be">“What is Drupal?”</a></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaOuQxsjs3E&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Understanding Drupal Documentary”</a> – this video uses an interview format, making it nicely organized and presented</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLcS7uIlqPo&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLtaXuX0nEZk_nhzuswLApDcZtq7qPPA6Z">“Drupal Beginner: What is Drupal?”</a> introduces the user to Drupal through tutorials; this video is the first in a series of many.</p><p>These two videos get more into the details of theming and module items. Even me, a Business Analyst, was able to understand them – amazing!!</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6zMcfTxkhc&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Part 1: Drupal Theming – Panels &amp; Panels Everywhere HD”</a></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjxML7A19Zs&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Introduction to Drupal Module Development”</a></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL_lkdxqmdw&amp;feature=youtu.be">“What makes Drupal special?”</a> is a video that presents the connection between Drupal and other big systems. It is quite interesting to see that Drupal has a lot of support from well-established technology companies like Sun.</p><p>With <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85xxX2EJY-c&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Drupal: An Open Source Community”</a> you can see how the Drupal community connects. This Acquia video introduces the viewer to many of the individuals involved with Drupal.</p><p>Finally, I couldn’t complete this list without adding a presentation from the creator of Drupal, Dries Buytaert: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utza0BCFYws&amp;feature=youtu.be">“The Dries-note”</a></p><p>Voila! I hope you enjoy viewing these Drupal-based videos – please send me your comments or share any other links you think are informative.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-blog-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Blog Tags:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/content-tags/drupal-0" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">drupal</a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a href="/content-tags/cms" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">CMS</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-section field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Section:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/section/drupal" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel">Drupal</a></div></div></div>
