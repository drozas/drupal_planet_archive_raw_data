    <p><a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Developer Days 2014</a> is coming up quick in Szeged, Hungary from March 24th (Mon) to the 30th (Sun) 2014. Szeged, Hungary may sound like it is the middle of nowhere but what do you need to get together with a bunch of Drupal developer friends and learn about and advance the platform together? As those who have been to DrupalCon Europe 2008 in the same city know, Szeged is the ideal place for just that. <a href="http://vimeo.com/75291337">Check out our interviews</a> about those experiences.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/75291337"><img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/DDDInterviews.png" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 2em 2em;" /></a> This is not only the event to come to if you want to learn about Drupal 8 but also to get involved with Drupal (core) development. If you are not a contributor yet we plan to have plenty opportunities to help get you on board. If you know what you want to work on, we'd love to get out of your way and provide you with all the pieces needed for you to work on outstanding Drupal 8 core issues. We expect hundreds of developers to attend this event, and core development involvement is not at all a requirement. However, if you are eager to help out, this is a great chance! This is the biggest continuous sprint of the year to help get Drupal 8 closer to release!</p>
<p>If you are just considering taking a deeper look at Drupal 8, this is the ideal event for you with hands-on workshops as well as key Drupal developers on location to work with to fix issues that bug you.</p>
<p><a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/">Our tickets start at just 30 EUR</a> and we also offer scholarships! We now accept presentation and workshop submissions as well as code sprint suggestions and signups! Let's explore and advance Drupal 8 together!</p>
<p><em>Ps. We are looking for sponsors to help put on the event and sponsor key Drupal core developers to attend! This is a great time to show your company's commitment to Drupal 8.</em></p>
