It has been a very difficult decision to make because I have enjoyed my time and the people I work with at the Association. However, I look forward to finding work that aligns more closely with my passion and my skills. I hope to stay in the Drupal community as working with the community has been one of the best parts of the job.</p></div></div></div>
