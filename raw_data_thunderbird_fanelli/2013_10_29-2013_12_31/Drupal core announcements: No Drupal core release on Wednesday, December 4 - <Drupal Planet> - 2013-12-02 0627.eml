    <p>The monthly Drupal core bug fix release window is scheduled for this Wednesday. However, I celebrated Thanksgiving this weekend rather than committing patches, and before that my time was taken up with getting the <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-7.24">Drupal 7.24 and 6.29 security releases</a> out the door.</p>
<p>As a result, there won't be a Drupal 7.x bug fix release this month.</p>
<p>Upcoming release windows include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, December 18 (security release window)</li>
<li>Wednesday, January 1 (bug fix release window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on Drupal core release windows, see the documentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info#when">release timing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173280">security releases</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/260803">discussion</a> that led to this policy being implemented.</p>
