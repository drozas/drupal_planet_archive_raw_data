Most Drupal sites contain a decent number of contributed modules. Before long, you might write your own custom modules. And then you might generate Features, which are also modules. You end up with a heck of a lot of modules! You could dump them all into the modules folder, but then how will you distinguish between what is custom and what is contributed? Sure you know what your custom modules are, but you will have to search for them through that long list of all those modules. If only they could be more organised! I have seen a variety of different approaches to organising code across all of the Drupal projects I have worked on and they all have their pros and cons.</p>
