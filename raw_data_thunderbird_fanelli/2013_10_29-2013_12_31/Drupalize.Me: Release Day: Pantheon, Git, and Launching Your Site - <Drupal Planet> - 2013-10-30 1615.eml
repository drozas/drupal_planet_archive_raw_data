    <p>This week we continue to re-publish lessons from the <a href="http://drupalize.me/series/pantheon-academy">Pantheon Academy</a>, with Jon Peck. In these free lessons we'll be taking a look at working with Git and <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/multidev">MultiDev</a>, the Pantheon cloud-based development environment for teams working on projects together. We'll also take a look at dealing with error codes, and setting up SSL fro your server. We're going to wrap up our current list with a checklist for taking your site live.</p>
