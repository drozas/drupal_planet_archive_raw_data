We managed about 100 accounts, although at any given time there were only a dozen or so active projects. I enjoyed the juggling and the coordination of the tasks, but I grew impatient with our developer, and taught myself more and more coding skills so that I could take on more and more of the tasks myself. Since then I've worn many hats, and coordinated many projects, but this year was the first time I officially wore the hat of "Project Manager" in my new position at Drupalize.Me.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-blog-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above text-secondary"><div class="field-label">Related Topics:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/taxonomy/term/149">project management</a></div></div></div>
