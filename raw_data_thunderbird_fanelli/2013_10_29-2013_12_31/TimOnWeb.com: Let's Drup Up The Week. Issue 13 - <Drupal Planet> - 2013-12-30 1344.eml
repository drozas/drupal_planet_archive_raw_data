The last week was pretty silent and it was hard to find something interesting, but in the end I've managed to dig some Drupal gold for you. Today will be no dessert, because of the sad events happening in my country of origin.</p>
<p>Wish you all a Happy New Year! Be healthy and happy, the rest is not so important. Let's Drup Up The Week!</p>
