    <p>With some CMSs such as Joomla, menus are very powerful features. They can control layouts, permissions, metadata and much more.</p>
<p>In Drupal, menus have almost no power at all. By default, menus are not capable of controlling much more than the destination of their link.</p>
<p>So, we end up with a lot of questions about menus. This week a member asked us how they control who can see menu links. This tutorial is our answer.</p>
<p>We're going to show how Drupal menu permissions work and how you can make them more powerful.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ostrainingdrupal/~4/iW6KxwLiTCA" height="1" width="1"/>
