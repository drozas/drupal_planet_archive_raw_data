Its an arrangement that provides both teams with the ability to leverage each others resources, talents, and mindshare, while doing our bit for the environment - making the most of physical assets that might otherwise be duplicated or wasted. Our goal in this arrangement is to help each other to provide a more complete offering and even more robust, cost effective solutions for our mutual clients and partners. </p>
