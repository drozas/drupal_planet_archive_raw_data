In fact, there is still a fair amount of work remaining. To help get some momentum, we are going to start holding CMI IRC meetings in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/drupal-cmi">#drupal-cmi</a> every other Monday at 20:00 UTC (3pm Eastern). Our next IRC meeting will be Monday, January 13 at 20:00 UTC. Additional meetings will be on January 27, February 10, 24, etc. All of the Drupal 8 initiative meetings, including the CMI meetings, are listed on the calendar on <a href="https://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core">Drupal 8 Updates and How to Help</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who is interested in helping to get Drupal 8 closer to having a working configuration system is welcome to join the IRC meetings. That said, we have a lot of complex problems to solve. While it would certainly be helpful to check out the the issues listed under the tabs above (<a href="focus">Focus Issues</a>, <a href="beta-blocker">Beta Blocker</a>, <a href="novice">Novice Issues</a>, etc.) our most important issues at the moment are listed on the meta issue <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2121751">Making configuration synchronisation work</a>.</p>
