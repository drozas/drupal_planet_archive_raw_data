    <p>The <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/drupalorg-working-groups/software">Drupal.org Software Working Group</a> is looking for volunteers to take on leadership roles and help guide development of the Drupal.org Developer Tools, which include Projects (project pages, releases, issue queues, change records), Version Control (git repositories, commit logs, repository viewer etc.) and Testbots.</p>
<p>This is by far, the most important part of Drupal.org. It's that section of the site which lets the community do their main thing - develop Drupal. It is, therefore, very important to have a clear decision making structure to ensure that we can deploy changes and improve the section to give Drupal contributors all the tools they need to do their jobs.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/372893/">current proposal</a> for the scope, roles, responsibilities and authority of the team.<br />
For the full background see <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/368148">this post</a>.</p>
<p>The Software Working Group will start appointing the new team on January 15, 2014. Right now we are looking for candidates for the roles on the team, specifically for <strong>Product Owner</strong>, <strong>Project Manager</strong>, <strong>UX Lead</strong>.<br />
Interested? Know someone who you think would be a great candidate? <a href="https://drupal.org/user/33570/contact">Let us know!</a></p>
