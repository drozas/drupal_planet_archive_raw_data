    <p>Back from Drupalcamp Vienna, where I talked about how supporting your users is one of the processes of web development that we should not forget about. I gathered some interesting feedback from visitors and again it proved how everyone is struggling with handing over any information on how to operate website. It either takes ages to create (screenshots and screencasts) or it is not reusable.</p>  </div>
