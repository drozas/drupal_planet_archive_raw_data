    <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>The #DrupalPicchu <a href="http://picchu2014.dlatino.org/sessions">sessions</a> have been published, and I will be making the <a href="http://picchu2014.dlatino.org/content/conquistando-para-drupal-un-proceso-agil-motorizado-por-incrementos-en-la-usabilidad-del" target="_blank">Drupal Lean Process</a> presentation in Cusco. In preparation, the <a href="https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean" target="_blank">lit-drupal-lean</a> project is in full swing right here on GitHub. Here's a short-list of what has been achieved so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the most important docs and guides and templates have been gleaned over to the <a href="https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a>. That includes material on MVP Planning, structured (hypotheses-driven) user stories, collaborative design and style and code guides, scaffolding and a host of templates to people your issue queue.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/issues?milestone=2&amp;page=1&amp;state=open" target="_blank">Milestone 1</a> is in full swing, and the <a href="https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/issues?milestone=2&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed" target="_blank">closed issues</a> include some very interesting stuff, like an <a href="https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/issues/27" target="_blank">everything in code manifesto and drush generated install profile + features solution</a>, etc.</li>
<li>The codebase in branch master already includes a complete distro starter set, which will then grow via the addition of features, some of which will be base features and will be turned on by the install profile, and some of them will be optional and simply present.</li>
</ul>
<div>The goal over the next thirty days is that the sample app, lit-drupal-lean, will constitute an easily GitHub clonable drupal + best of breed modules starter kit with built in lean process.</div>
<div>That process will evolve and grow, and will form the basis of a book I wish to publish or self-publish early next year, which will in turn serve as the basis for my current mentoring endeavors for organizations and companies in the <em>process</em>. In the process of forming their own standing teams.</div>
<div>So, <a href="https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/star">star</a> me on GitHub, please! That's where I'm spending most of my time.
