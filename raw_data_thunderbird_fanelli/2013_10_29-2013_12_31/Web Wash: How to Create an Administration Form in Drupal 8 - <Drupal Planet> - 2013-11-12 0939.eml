<p>In the past, I've created a basic form where an editor was able to change a bit of content next to the logo. Instead of hard coding it in the template, the editor would simply change the content from within Drupal.</p>

<p>In Drupal 7, you can build a basic administration form by defining a form and passing it through the <code>system_settings_form()</code> function. And of course, creating a menu item, so the form is accessible.</p>

<p>In Drupal 8, however, things are slightly different.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create a basic administration form in Drupal 8. I'll create a form for the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/snippets">Code Snippets</a> module that allows a user to select which element (<code>pre</code> or <code>code</code>) should wrap the code displayed by the module.</p>
