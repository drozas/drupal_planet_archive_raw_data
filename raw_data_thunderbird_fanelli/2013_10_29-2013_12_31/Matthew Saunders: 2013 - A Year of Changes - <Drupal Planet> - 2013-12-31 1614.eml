Happy New Year to all.  2013 was a year of many changes.  These were professional, personal, and on a more macro level.  I had recently left my job with Trellon to pursue contract work.  We had just finished renovating our kitchen - just in time for a New Year's Eve party that involved a large percentage of guests from the Drupal community.  Our little dog, diagnosed with mast cell cancer, wasn't expected to live for much longer (spoiler - he's still kicking it with us).  Congress, in the United States, continued to be deadlocked culminating in a partial shutdown of the government, and a populace that was sick and tired of 534 people who simply could not agree on anything.  There was a seriously flawed rollout of the healthcare Website, which as a Web Application professional I found fascinating.<p></p>
<p>I thought that sharing some bits and pieces from my life over the last year might be fun.  If you feel interested enough to follow along my geeky and Drupally year, that would be just fine.</p>
<p></p><h2>January</h2><br />
I had started working as an independent consultant with several clients late in 2012.  The biggest one was <a href="http://5ringsweb.com/">5 Rings Web</a>, where I was consulting as the COO and managing the project management side of the shop for my good friend Lindsay Ogden.  5 Rings is largely a Drupal shop and I started by auditing processes and helping the group of excellent developers and designers organize in a more efficient manner.  I was lucky to work with some terrific clients supporting existing Drupal sites but also defining some complex architectures for several companies and helping the team organize around Agile Sprints to bring web products to market.  I am very proud of the work I did there when I was more heavily involved in working with them.  Some how I managed, while doing operations for both Vintage Digital and 5 Rings to write a blog post on <a href="http://www.dogstar.org/drupal/content/managing-web-assets-across-multiple-dropboxes">Managing Multiple Drop boxes</a>
<p></p><h2>March</h2><br />
In March the community found out that <a href="http://www.dogstar.org/drupal/content/so-long-neil-and-marta-and-thanks-all-fish">Neil and Marta</a> were leaving the Drupal Association in a restructure of the organization.  This came as a shock to many.  There were those who had really come to know Neil and respected his hard work on the Drupalcon.  He had a pretty rough go of it with <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/">Drupalcon Denver</a> in 2012 as he better integrated into the community.  I was amongst those who were deeply saddened by the departure.  Holly reached out to many in the community, including myself, to reassure us.
