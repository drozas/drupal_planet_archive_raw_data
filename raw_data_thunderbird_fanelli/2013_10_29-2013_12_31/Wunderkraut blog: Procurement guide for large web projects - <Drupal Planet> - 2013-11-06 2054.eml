    We want to change the way large web projects are done. Every year we see many projects with excellent procurement practices. At the same time, the majority of procurements we see could use at least some improvement. Bad procurement is not only bad for vendors, it&#039;s also really bad for the customers. Fixing the procurement process is the first part in succeeding in a large web project.  </p>
<div class="field-ns-blog-post-body clearfix">
            <div class="field-item even"> <p><span><span>The series of blog posts is kicked off by taking a look at the overall procurement process. We'll dig deeper in each step in the process in the following blog posts. One of the goals of blogging each step is to get internal and external feedback on each step to help us improve them, so please post any feedback in the comments.</span></span></p><h2><span>Assumptions for this guide</span></h2><p><span><span>The primary assumption we make in this guide is a customer-vendor relationship. The guide is applicable when combining in-house and external team, or when outsourcing an entire project. However, the beginning of the guide is useful even when working with in-house teams.</span></span></p><p><span>Our second assumption is using an agile process model. We only deal with large projects in this guide and the chances of success in these projects are considerably lower with a design-first approach. We don't specify the flavour of agile to be used and some parts also apply to smaller projects, but the focus is definitely on agile.</span></p><p><span>The third assumption is that it is a large project. Our definition of large in this guide is more than 100 working days. While this isn’t large compared to many historic enterprise or government projects, modern web technologies have dramatically accelerated the process of development, and therefore the definition of what constitutes ‘large’. With the current level of efficiency of web platforms a project can get really complicated already within the scope of 100 working days. This can be very loosely translated to budget of €$£100 thousand or more. However, many lessons in this guide are applicable for smaller projects as well.</span></p><p><span>We don't make assumptions on restrictions placed on the procurement process by internal rules or for example public sector procurement. Procurement rules may limit your ability to use the guide, but in our experience most of this guide can be used even with very restrictive procurement guidelines.</span></p><h2><img alt="procurement-guide-for-large-web-projects.png" class="media-image" height="734" title="procurement-guide-for-large-web-projects.png" width="576" src="http://wunderkraut.com/sites/wunderkraut.com/files/procurement-guide-for-large-web-projects.png" /></h2><h2><span>Starting a project</span></h2><p><span><span>There is a series of steps to be taken when starting a project. We'll talk about budgeting, identifying the key stakeholders, how to get management buy-in early and other important topics related to starting a project.</span></span></p><h2><span>Setting project goals</span></h2><p><span><span>Project goals are way too often set based on pain points with current systems or unvalidated assumptions. We'll help you to dig deeper to get to the real business goals and to communicate them clearly.</span></span></p><h2><span>Setting measurements for the goals</span></h2><p><span><span>It's good to have goals, but how do you know if you've reached your goals without measurements? We'll talk about how to define and measure success, what kind of measurements are reliable and how to use the goals in your project.</span></span></p><h2><span>Discovery</span></h2><p><span><span>Using an agile process model doesn't mean no design what so ever. A level of discovery is always required in any project. We'll walk you through setting phases, identifying epic stories, analysing risks and other key parts of the discovery process.</span></span></p><h2><span>Choosing the project model</span></h2><p><span><span>One of the most important decisions in a project. Should you go <a href="http://wunderkraut.com/blog/are-you-agile-or-just-faking-it/2013-07-12">all agile</a> or <a href="http://wunderkraut.com/blog/how-to-fail-in-a-drupal-project-fixed-price-contracts/2013-07-10">design everything first</a>? We'll help you identify the ideal process model for your project. The guide will not cover design first, but it will help you to identify when to use it.</span></span></p><h2><span>Choosing the technology</span></h2><p><span><span>After you know your high level goals, epic stories and risks you are ready to choose the technology. Two major parts of any web project are the vendor and the technology. Changing the vendor is relatively easy, changing technologies is difficult. We'll help you to choose the </span><span>right</span><span> technology before letting the sales guys (who live on commission for selling </span><span>expensive</span><span> technologies) in.</span></span></p><h2><span>Request for information</span></h2><p><span><span>In some cases you may already have the shortlist of vendors after the initial discovery and choosing the technology, in other cases you have to start with the long list and do a RFI phase. The purpose of the RFI is to use qualification criteria to filter only the most suitable vendors for the RFP process. We'll cover typical criteria used in a light-weight RGI process to filter the long list into a short one.</span></span></p><h2><span>Shortlisting vendors</span></h2><p><span><span>In a typical process you would shortlist 2-4 of the most suitable vendors for the RFP process. We'll cover the best light-weight ways to make the selections and how to communicate during the process.</span></span></p><h2><span>Ask for feedback on the RFP</span></h2><p><span><span>After shortlisting it's a good idea to ask for feedback on your RFP before it's finalised. This allows you to fix problems and avoid misunderstandings before sending it out. We'll cover the best practise on how to run this in an efficient and open way to reach the best results.</span></span></p><h2><span>Request for proposal</span></h2><p><span><span>The final RFP document will ask for outlined schedule, comparable examples, references, team interviews, confirmed customer references and other important facts from the vendors. The process is fast and efficient, but provides all required information. We'll include examples of an outline for a great RFP and talk about how to run the process.</span></span></p><h2><span>Trial sprint</span></h2><p><span><span>Actions speak louder than words. In agile projects you are paying for time of a team and comparing productivity of two teams can be very challenging. In a large project doing a paid trial sprint is worth the extra trouble. We'll cover how to organise a trial sprint, how to measure the results and how to compare the teams.</span></span></p><h2><span>Choosing the vendor</span></h2><p><span><span>After all these steps you are ready to choose one or more vendors. We'll cover agile contracting and how to make sure the team shares the same goals.</span></span></p><h2><span>Doing a retrospective</span></h2><p><span><span>Having a great procurement process is only the start, you should also learn from all parts of the process. After the process is complete you should do a retrospective session with each vendor and talk about what was great and what needs improving. We’ll talk about what the vendors want to get out of a retrospective and what to ask from them.</span></span></p> </div>
