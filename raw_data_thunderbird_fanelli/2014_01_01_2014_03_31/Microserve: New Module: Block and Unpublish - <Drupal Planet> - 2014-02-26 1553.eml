On occasion we find ourselves working on something that could work as a standalone module and solve common Drupal issues. Even with our often busy schedules we like  to stay on the lookout for these kinds of opportunities for us to contribute back to the Drupal community.</p>
<p>So today we’re proud to announce our latest contributed module - <a href="https://drupal.org/project/block_and_unpublish">Block and Unpublish</a>. This module adds a new option to the Drupal user bulk-operations; the ability to block users and unpublish their content and comments in a single action. The functionality is pretty basic but it does save a lot of time where needed and conserves user data while administrators decide their next action.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Use Case</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This module comes in handy on sites that contain user-generated content. When dealing with such privileged users in some cases it’s necessary for the administrator to, temporarily or permanently, hide content posted by a particular user. Block and Unpublish allows you to do this easily, without having to sift through heaps of content and edit nodes/comments individually.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to use</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It’s quite straight forward. Simply navigate to the “People” page, tick the users whom you want to block and unpublish their content, then choose the “Block user and unpublish content &amp; comments” option and submit.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>You can also revert this action by following the same instructions but selecting “Undo: Block user and unpublish content &amp; comments” instead.</div>
