    <p>Soon after I started working at Lullabot, I got my first client, and like all clients this one had a problem. They were a university whose site was running on Drupal 6: 2500 page nodes filled with HTML. The layout was largely managed through the WYSIWYG, and the quality of the HTML was all over the place. They wanted to take this site and migrate it to Drupal 7, with a properly designed content model and responsive layout, possibly using Panels.</p>

<p>In six months.</p>

<p>With one developer on staff.</p>
