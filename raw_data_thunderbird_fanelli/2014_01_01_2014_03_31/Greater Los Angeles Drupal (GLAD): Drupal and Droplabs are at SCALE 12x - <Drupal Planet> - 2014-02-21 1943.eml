    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Drupal once again has a one-two punch presence at <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.com">SCALE</a>, the Southern California Linux Expo, this year at the Hilton LAX with both a <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> booth and a <a href="http://droplabs.net">Droplabs</a> booth. The expo floor, which is packed with thousands of conference-goers and dozens of exhibitors with interests in all things open source, opens tomorrow, Saturday, February 22nd, and is open until end of day on Sunday, February 23rd.</p>
<p>Droplabs is also a <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/sponsor/droplabs">SCALE media sponsor</a> of the expo this year and will have a session on Friday, February 21st about its <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/building-droplabs-business-model-open-source-community">open source business model</a> and how Droplabs grew to become the world's <a href="http://droplabs.net/news/droplabs-recognized-as-worlds-top-drupal-location">Top Drupal Location</a>, as recognized by Drupical last year.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more and talk shop about Drupal, head over to the Drupal booth on either Saturday or Sunday and talk with the awesome volunteers there. While you're there, be sure to sign up for <a href="https://gladcamp.org">GLADCamp</a>, the Greater Los Angeles Drupal Camp, a free conference for All Things Drupal that's fast approaching on March 7th, 8th &amp; 9th, in Pasadena, California!</p>
<p>If you're looking for a meetup venue for Drupal and other open source topics, head over to the Droplabs booth to learn how you can have your event <a href="https://droplabs.net/services/venue-rental#we-host-meetups">hosted for free</a>. You can also ask Droplabs about how to get unlimited access to the Drupal <a href="https://droplabs.net/programs/video-learning-and-mentoring">video learning</a> sites that Droplabs has site licenses for (BuildAModule, OSTraining and Drupalize.me).</p>
<p>Both booths need help with volunteers and those volunteers may be able to attend the expo for free. Check with the booth managers for more information. For Droplabs, get in touch at <a href="https://droplabs.net/contact">https://droplabs.net/contact</a> and for the Drupal booth, see <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/401543">https://groups.drupal.org/node/401543</a></p>
<p>See you at SCALE!</p>
