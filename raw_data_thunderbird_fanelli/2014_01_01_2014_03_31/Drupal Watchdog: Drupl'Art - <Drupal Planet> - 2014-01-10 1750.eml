<p>At DrupalCon Paris, I attended a grid presentation by Mark Boulton, for designers. I didnâ€™t get it. Recently I read the biography of Steve Jobs. Now I get it. Drupal designers like Mark focus on the art outside. For several issues, this column has focused on the art <em>inside</em>. At the risk of redundancy, let me state that when I talk about Drupl'Art I am talking mostly about the art within.</p>
<h3>Aesthetic Minimalist</h3>
<p>Like all artists, I navigate my craft through stylistic seas. Most recently, I sailed into an Extreme Minimalist Period: fewer lines of code mattered to me. Eventually, Charlie (chx) politely suggested that, if I insisted on charting that course, to at least comment it better. He was right, I was wrong; and I offer up a heart-felt mea culpa to the developers who followed in my turbulent wake and are now stuck with the flotsam and jetsam.</p>
<p>I am still a Minimalist, but now an aesthetically practical Minimalist; readability and maintainability carry the day. Farewell to saving opcodes!</p>
