This is the ideal place for Drupal Dev Days, a whole week of sprinting with learning and participation opportunities plenty on Drupal coding and all the related technologies involved. Here are five good reasons to register for this event now:</p>
<ol><li>It is the biggest distraction-free sprint to work out remaining issues in Drupal 8 in the whole year. <strong>The sprint runs from Monday morning to Sunday night</strong>. Szeged wants to provide enough but also be out of your way to be awesome! For example, we booked the same venue up until midnight each day.</li>
<li>We believe it is <strong>essential for a successful core sprint to have core committers on location</strong>. Szeged will have Alex Pott and Nathaniel Catchpole with Angie Byron supporting from home while we sleep. If you are a core developer in any capacity, having these two great leads directly at the same place is an amazing opportunity.</li>
<li>Of course there is no requirement to be a core developer to attend! If you want to join the <a href="http://ericduran.github.io/drupalcores/">list of almost 1800 Drupal 8 developers</a> though, <a href="http://drupalize.me/">Drupalize.me</a> is flying in Joe Shindelar and Amber Himes to deliver the <strong>Community Tools Workshop</strong> to get you on board with all the tools and processes used in Drupal core and contributed module/theme development. Great new skill to have under your sleeves in 2014. There is not much hard about it once you get started.</li>
<li>We are taking the BADCamp/DrupalCon labs concept and provide options for speakers to deliver 2 hour and 4 hour long workshops for a fuller deep-dive on development topics. Even if you don't want to be a developer of Drupal itself in any capacity, there is a good chance that <strong>if you earn money with Drupal, you would benefit from some of these deep-dives</strong>. This is a unique format that other events don't offer. (Admittedly we are short on submitted sessions so far. If you, yourself would love to deliver such a deep-dive or a regular session, see <a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/program/sessions">http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/program/sessions</a>, <strong>submissions close on January 15th (in 12 days)</strong>!)</li>
<li>Szeged is a great cozy town! Many of those who have been there in 2008 asked us repeatedly to organise a come-back opportunity. Here it is and <strong>it only costs 30 EUR now</strong>! See our interview video on Szeged experiences at <a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/community/attendees">http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/community/attendees</a>. You won't regret coming.</li>
