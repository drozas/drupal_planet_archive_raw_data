    <title>Drupal Notes: Goodbye Drupal, Hello Django!</title>
    <base href="http://drupalnotes.com/post/74947559516">

  <body id="msgFeedSummaryBody" selected="false">
    <p>I&#8217;ve been developing primarily with Drupal for around 7 years, but, after some careful consideration over the past few weeks, i&#8217;ve decided to move away from Drupal Development.</p>
<p>During those 7 years i&#8217;ve had some successes in launching sites, i&#8217;ve learnt a lot and improved immeasurably as a developer. However, i&#8217;ve also had plenty of frustrating moments and things that have taken much longer than expected.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been feeling a bit burnt out while trying to rebuild a reasonably large Drupal 5 site on and off for the past 3 years. First attempts were made in Drupal 6 due to lack of contrib modules being ready, but then switched to Drupal 7.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t blame all my lack of progess on Drupal, during that time I completed an international relocation and did several other projects, but I did spend a lot of time on it and found myself fighting Drupal a great deal!</p>
<h3>Taking a Timeout</h3>
<p>A few months a go, I decided to take a break from this rebuild, and rather than take on drupal sites for a client, I decided to do some python development, ironically enough, creating a developer workflow and deployment tool for Drupal (&amp; other frameworks).</p>
<p>When the tool got to a working state, I started to switch back to Drupal development, and then it hit me - I just didn&#8217;t like developing in DrupalÂ  anymore, the fun had gone and i was tired of forcing Drupal to do what I wanted and constantly chasing my tail trying to keep up with the painful upgrade cycles.</p>
<p>It took a while for me to come to terms with this, my first thought was I had to continue regardless as I have so much time invested in Drupal, and know my way around pretty much every area of code. But the feeling didn&#8217;t go away, and so I also spent some time researching alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> had been on my radar for a while, and i had been planning to try it, but in the end I honed in on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> due to my experience using python. Once I immersed myself in a few tutorials it started to click and since then I haven&#8217;t looked back, and so far, recreating the site in question in Django is a much smoother process for me and it does feel like a relief to have changed direction.</p>
<h3>Why post about this on DrupalNotes.com?</h3>
<p>I didn&#8217;t post this as a rant about Drupal, or to flame any Drupal vs Django argument. I just wanted to get some of these personal feelings off my chest, and while I am by no means a notable member of the Drupal community, to say my goodbyes.</p>
<p>Over the years, i have come to appreciate the Drupal community and the infrastructure it has in place. There is a ton of functionality available that people have spent many, many hours creating. I had always intended to contribute more personally, for the reasons mentioned above, apart from a few modules and patches here and there, i didn&#8217;t manage to.</p>
<p>So, thanks to all you in the Drupal community for all your work, good luck with the transition to Drupal 8.</p>

<p>P.S. I&#8217;m not sure what to do with the domain for this blog, drupalnotes.com, as I won&#8217;t be active in Drupal any more, i&#8217;m unlikely to have many notes about it. If any one is keen to acquire it and finish the job please let me know.</p>
