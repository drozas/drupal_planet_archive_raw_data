    <p>A few days ago, while I was writing a bit of Silex code and grumbling at Doctrine DBAL's <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL-182">lack of</a> support for a <a href="https://drupal.org/node/310085">SQL Merge</a> operation, I wondered if it wouldn't be possible to use DBTNG without the rest of Drupal.</p>

<p>Obviously, although DBTNG is described as having been <a href="https://github.com/Crell/DBTNG/blob/master/README.txt">designed for standalone use</a>: <q cite="https://github.com/Crell/DBTNG/blob/master/README.txt">DBTNG should be a stand-alone library with no external dependences other than PHP 5.2 and the PDO database library</q>, in actual use, the Github DBTNG repo has seen no commit in the last 3 years, and the D8 version is still not a Drupal 8 "Component" (i.e. decoupled code), but still a plain library with Drupal dependencies. How would it fare on its own ? Let's give it a try...</p>
