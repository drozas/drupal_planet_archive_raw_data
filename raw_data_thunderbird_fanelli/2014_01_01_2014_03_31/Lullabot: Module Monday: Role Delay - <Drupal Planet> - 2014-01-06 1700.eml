    <p>It is not uncommon to want to assign a role to a user after they have been a member-in-good-standing of a site for a period of time. Perhaps this role will grant them access to do some content moderation, or gain access to new features like voting on posts. The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/role_delay">Role Delay</a> module was created for just this purpose, and it fulfills its 'role' admirably.</p>
