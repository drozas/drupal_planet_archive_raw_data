<p class="normal">As a Drupal Developer, I develop features for new and existing sites, manage deployments, participate in code reviews with team members, and perform client trainings.</p>
<p class="normal">I also work with other developers to contribute to new and existing Drupal modules, and give knowledge shares on new technology or sharing things learned at a recent conference.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're so glad to have you!  Give us an idea of what professional path brought you here.</strong></p>
