    <p>In 2013 I was invited by Packt Publishing to play a role of technical editor in one of their books.<br />
Just got my sample of the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/premium-drupal-themes/book">&#8220;Premium Drupal Themes&#8221;</a> by mail.<br />
It was an honor and nice experience for me, and now I hope to find time and become an author some day :)<br />
