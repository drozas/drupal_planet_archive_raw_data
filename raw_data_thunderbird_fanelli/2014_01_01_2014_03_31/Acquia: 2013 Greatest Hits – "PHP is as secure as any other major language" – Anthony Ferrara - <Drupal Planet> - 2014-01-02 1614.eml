He was among the first people I spoke with on mic about PHP. Our conversation about PHP being secure was one of the seeds that grew into the <a href="/blog/power-of-php">"Power of PHP"</a> series on Acquia.com, though you'll notice we were still calling it "PHP Myths" at the time. The series will be continuing in 2014, stay tuned to the <a href="/podcasts">Acquia podcast</a> and the <a href="/blog">Acquia blog</a> for more!</p>
