I have been a volunteer Drupal.org infrastructure maintainer since 2009. This month I started full time at the Drupal Association managing the Drupal.org infrastructure, which I am extremely excited about -- volunteer work has become my day job!</p>
<p>One of my first projects is to improve the development process for people interested in contributing to Drupal.org.</p>
