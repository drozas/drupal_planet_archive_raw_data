In my session, we went over the new features of <a href="http://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/resource-guide-drupal-8" target="_blank">Drupal 8</a> and what you can expect to see in the forthcoming version. From CMI, views in core, web services, mobile and HTML5 we talked about the new features and showed a live demo of some of the new features. In addition the session covered how to help finalize Drupal 8 and get involved yourself.</p>
