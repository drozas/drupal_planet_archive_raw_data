This email can be used to ask for feedback or promote useful features.</p>

<p>This type of functionality can be built in a few ways. You could use a 3rd party email service like <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> or <a href="http://www.aweber.com/">AWeber</a> to send the follow-up as an auto-responder.</p>

<p>Another possibility, is to send the follow-up email directly from Drupal.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I'll show you how to use Rules Scheduler (part of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a>) to send a follow-up email one week after a user registers.</p>

<p>Now, every website is different and you may want to send this email after three days or one month. By using Rules, you can adjust this type of configuration directly from Drupal without writing any custom code.</p>
