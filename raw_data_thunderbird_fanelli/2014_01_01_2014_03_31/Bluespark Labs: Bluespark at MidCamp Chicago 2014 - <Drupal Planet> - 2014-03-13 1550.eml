    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>Bluespark is pleased to announce our participation at this year's <a href="http://2014.midcamp.org/" target="_blank">Drupal MidCamp</a>&nbsp;conference at the University Center in&nbsp;Chicago, IL on March 28-30, 2014. There's a lot to learn that weekend, so we're happy to keep everyone alert and focused and to show our support for the Drupal community by <a href="http://2014.midcamp.org/sponsor/bluespark" target="_blank">sponsoring&nbsp;coffee service</a> for the event. So, make plans to attend now&nbsp;and while you're there&nbsp;grab a cup 'o joe (or several) on us and enjoy the sessions.</p>

<p>Speaking of sessions, the&nbsp;Bluespark&nbsp;team is&nbsp;giving two sessions this year. The first, on Saturday at 10:30 am in the Loop Room, is "<a href="http://2014.midcamp.org/session/cxual-healing-content-creators-are-people-too" target="_blank">CXual&nbsp;Healing, Content Creators are People Too!</a>" given by Technical Director <a href="/team/adrian-rollett">Adrian Rollett</a>. In this session, he will show site builders and coders quick-win techniques that we have used to make our sites easier to use for an important, but often overlooked role: site content managers, creators, and curators. The next session, given later Saturday at 3:00 pm in the Arts Room, is "<a href="http://2014.midcamp.org/session/how-changing-our-estimation-process-took-our-project-endgame-wtf-ftw" target="_blank">How Changing our Estimation Process Took our Project Endgame from WTF? to FTW!â€‹</a>" presented by Project and Transition Manager <a href="/team/ashleigh-thevenet">Ashleigh Thevenet</a>. Speaking to business people and project managers, Ashleigh will show you how we improve client expectation management through increased transparency via our estimation processes. Both sessions are going to be informative and instructive so be sure to add them to your schedule.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you in Chicago!</p>
