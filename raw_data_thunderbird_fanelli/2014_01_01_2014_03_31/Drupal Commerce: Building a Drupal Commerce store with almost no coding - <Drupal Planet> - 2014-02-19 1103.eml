<p>Last summer, when I came back from my traditional wedding in China with my awesome wife, I realized that there was no way for us to buy clothes for couples in France, whereas it is so common in China.<br />
That’s the reason why we decided (<em>my wife and I</em>) to bring that concept into Europe, starting in France. But we had to tweak the concept a bit to fit a European market, since European couples don’t act the same and tend to be more individualistic than Asian couples. So we had to create designs that our customers could wear separately, as well as a couple. We started with t-shirts since they’re fairly easy to produce and sell.</p>
