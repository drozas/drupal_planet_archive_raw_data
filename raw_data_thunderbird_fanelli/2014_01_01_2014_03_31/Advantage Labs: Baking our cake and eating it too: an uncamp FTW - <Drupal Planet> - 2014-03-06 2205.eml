<p>In the past 3 years the Twin Cities Drupal community has organized one of the best annual Drupal camps in the country.  But still we find learning gaps -- people new to Drupal looking for help answering questions they haven't yet formed; advanced developers seeking challenges; self-taught site-builders wanting to understand if they've put the pieces together correctly.  Staring at another 7 months before our <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/405493">next DrupalCamp Twin Cities</a>, this past Saturday we hosted the first ever Twin Cities Drupal Open House (TCD'OH!) in an effort to address the difficulty of being everything for everybody every time.</p>
