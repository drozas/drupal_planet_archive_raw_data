    <p>Howdy perfers! This week is just a quick note to let you know about a new release for the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/fastclick">FastClick Drupal module</a> which provides integration for the <a href="http://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/">FastClick <span class="caps">JS</span> library by <span class="caps">FTL</span>abs</a>. Drop it on your sites and feel the difference on touch&nbsp;phones!</p>
<h2>300ms tap delay makes for slower&nbsp;browsing</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed a delay between when you tap a link or other <span class="caps">UI</span> element and when it finally reacts? This is a solution to remove that delay! It is natively removed in newer versions of Chrome on Android, but for all browsers in iOS this library provides a very noticable&nbsp;improvement.</p>
<p>You can read about the history, watch a video that demonstrates the effect, and read the rationale for iOS&#8217;s continued use of 300ms delay in this <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away"><span class="caps">HTML</span>5 Rocks article</a>.</p>
<h2>Drupal module provides&nbsp;integration</h2>
<p>The Drupal module is slim, but it makes for easy integration by downloading a copy of the library to <strong>sites/all/libraries/fastclick</strong> and adding the script into the footer area instead of up top in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. The maintainer, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/2301194">Pere Orga</a>, is very responsive to issues and open to discussion for&nbsp;improvements.</p>
<p>Code can be found at <a href="https://drupal.org/project/fastclick">https://drupal.org/project/fastclick</a></p>
