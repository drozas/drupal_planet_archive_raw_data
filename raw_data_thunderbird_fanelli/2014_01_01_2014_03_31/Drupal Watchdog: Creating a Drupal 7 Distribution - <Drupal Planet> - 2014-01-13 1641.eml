<p>Prior to version 7, most Drupal users — and even administrators — had little need to be familiar with the inner workings of distributions and installation profiles. For versions 6 and earlier, when installing a fresh copy of Drupal core, one naturally would specify the minimum required information: database connection, website name, and superuser   account. Yet one had no opportunity to affect the list of modules and themes initially enabled, the default content types, or any other configuration details. However, anyone installing Drupal 7 is presented with a choice of installation profiles: "Standard" (the default) and "Minimal".</p>
<p>An installation profile comprises a set of files that completely describe how to configure a new installation of Drupal core, and can be made part of a distribution.</p>
