    <div id="comment-wrapper-nid-1395"></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">We know first-hand how committed those of you working in marketing and branding agencies are to delivering the best in branding solutions for your clients. This requires employing the most optimal tools for whatever medium you’re working in; whether it’s classic print advertising, or cutting-edge experiential branding. When it comes to website design and development, we here at Propeople have found that Drupal provides some of the best features for agencies and clients to create a great user experience, advance a brand, and, ultimately, reach their goals. </span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">There are many great tools and platforms available for building websites, and, as a full-service <a href="http://www.wearepropeople.com">digital agency</a> that delivers solutions outside of Drupal, we fully understand that different issues can call for different tools. However, we believe that it’s no coincidence that Drupal has emerged as the CMS of choice for many developers and website administrators out there. Drupal’s powerful and user-friendly framework, its reputation as an enterprise level platform, and ability to fully integrate overall branding and digital marketing strategies, will likely lead many agencies’ clients to request Drupal for their <a href="/services">web projects</a>. Here are seven great things that Drupal has to offer to your agency, and your clients.</span></p><p> </p><h4>1. High Functionality and Ease of Use</h4><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">In terms of ease of use, Drupal CMS is highly user-friendly and responsive. It can cater to both the technical and non-technical clients while at the same time providing the exact benefits and features that an advanced user would have access too. So, you might be thinking, “There has to be a catch here”. The only caveat is that Drupal can prove to have a steeper learning curve for developers than other CMS. However, it is very manageable for content administrators and end users. </span></p><h4>2. Drupal is a Great Tool for Social Media</h4><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">To say that social media is important for a company in this day and age is a great understatement. With the amount of modules available for Twitter and Facebook integration, Drupal is the most versatile CMS when it comes to social media. As an example, the Metatag module allows for the publication of Twitter cards on the client’s website. With a Gigya Socialize module, visitors can log on to your website on their social logins and post from their own accounts be it from Facebook or Twitter, to name a few. Someone saw you a have new awesome product in your pipeline and they want to tell more people about it? Cool! They can invite a friend from Facebook or followers Twitter in mere seconds to see it. With Drupal the potential for increased viral exposure and interaction using social media is higher and less “pushy”.</span></p><h4>3. Drupal Has Great SEO/SEM Computability (Compliant with HTML)</h4><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Any client of yours will require their website to attract a healthy flow of traffic. And so they should, because a successful web presence is usually what sets the first good impression for potential customers (at least if you can’t meet in person, of course). </span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">SEO is key if you want a site to be that number one hit on Google. Is your new marketing campaign getting the viral exposure it needs? Do you want your services to be noticed by potential clients? With Drupal, you have access to clean urls, meta-tags, and customizable titles and headings. With these tools, any prospective client would be able to fully take advantage of significant exposure for their product or services.</span></p><h4>4. Built-in Google Analytics Integration</h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Who visits a site, and what they do while they’re there, is one of the most important things to monitor in order to optimize that site to meet a client’s needs, and the needs of their audience. Want to see which product was most viewed or which blog on the website was the most popular? These are the kinds of questions that come up most frequently when figuring out what specific features of a site garner the most attention.</span></p><p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Drupal makes this easy, featuring built-in integration with Google Analytics, the most popular tracking tool on the web. While there are other modules that address the statistical aggregation of your web presence, having the most commonly used, and most efficient, service out there surely guarantees your client’s ROI. </span></p><h4 class="p1">5. Great Collaborative Community With Countless Contributors</h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being an open source CMS with a highly collaborative <a href="http://drupal.org/marketplace/propeople">open source community</a> attached to it, Drupal tends to avoid any hurdles associated with proprietary systems. So, the next foreseeable question would be: “That’s all great, but how does this benefit my client?”. For one, the knowledge of a huge number of developers can be leveraged to solve a problem or create something great in terms of contributed modules that further enhances the versatility of a website. </span></p><p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">At the exact second this blog is being written, there are approximately one million users of Drupal around the world, with about thirty thousand being developers. Imagine a tenth of those developers working individually on a new module or a new feature. The opportunities for development and innovation become very interesting. Additionally, a client benefits from full transparency of the code that’s being used and features implemented. No tricks, no hidden fees or elements, and no problems. </span></p><h4 class="p1"><span style="line-height: 23.078125px;">6. Countless Modules to Appeal to Every Client's Needs</span></h4><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Modules are community-contributed add-ons for Drupal that give you the tools to do exactly what you need to on a client’s website. We’re sure we harped enough on this in the previous items, however, this is a huge feature that adds value to Drupal. The Drupal library of thousands of modules is essential in an interactive world that is keen on available options and customized to their web presence. Whether it’s social media integration, e-commerce functionality, or different kinds of content editing, Drupal’s got you covered. </span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Interested in learning more about how your agency, and your clients, can benefit from using Drupal?
