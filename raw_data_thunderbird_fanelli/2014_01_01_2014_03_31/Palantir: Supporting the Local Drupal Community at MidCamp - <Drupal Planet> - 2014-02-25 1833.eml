            <p>One of the ways that Palantir gives back to the communities that support the open source tools we use is by helping to organize and sponsor local and regional events. One upcoming event that we’re very excited about is <a href="http://www.midcamp.org/">MidCamp</a>, a three-day celebration of all things Drupal here in Chicago March 28-30.  </p>
<p>MidCamp is a brand-new Drupal event designed to educate and engage Drupal users and evaluators throughout the Midwest. It will feature three days of training, curated sessions, and sprints for those looking to increase their Drupal knowledge and for the opportunity to rub shoulders with internationally-renowned Drupal experts.</p>
<p>One of those experts is our own Larry Garfield, who will be co-presenting MidCamp’s Saturday keynote along with Lullabot’s Jeff Eaton. They’ll be providing a tour of the upcoming Drupal 8, talking not just about its new features but also its new philosophy.</p>
<p>For those looking for a more in-depth look, Palantir will be offering two half-day training sessions on Friday for Drupal <a href="http://2014.midcamp.org/training/introduction-drupal-8-site-building">site builders</a> and <a href="http://2014.midcamp.org/training/introduction-drupal-8-module-development">module developers</a> who want to be able to hit the ground running with Drupal 8 once it’s released.</p>
<p>And with several Palantir team members having proposed sessions for MidCamp and planning to participate in Sunday’s sprints, you’ll be sure to see some of us around all three days of the conference.</p>
<p>Located at the University Center in downtown Chicago, MidCamp is situated within walking distance of many of the city’s tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife.</p>
<p>But what sets MidCamp truly apart is that it is a community effort, organized and supported by volunteers and sponsors from a wide variety of companies and organizations throughout the region. Among those volunteers is our own Andrea Soper, who is leading the planning team. Other Palantir team members helping out with various aspects of the event include Nate Striedinger, Bec White, and myself. In addition, we’ve also thrown our financial support behind the event as one of its Gold-level sponsors.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an existing Drupal user, developer, designer, site builder, or are someone new to the community, you won’t want to miss out on MidCamp.
