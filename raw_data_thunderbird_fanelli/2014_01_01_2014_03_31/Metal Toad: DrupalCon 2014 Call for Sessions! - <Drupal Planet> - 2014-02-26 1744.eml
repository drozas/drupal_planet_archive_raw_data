    <p>It's that time again!  DrupalCon is right around the corner and it's time to submit your talk.  The theme this year is Drupal 8 and that means that we'll be covering things like Symphony, Twig, and the other new components that make up Drupal 8.  Do you have a talk about how to use the new templating system?  Want to share how OOP works in Drupal 8?  <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/submit-session">Submit your session now!</a>  See you in Austin!</p>
<p>The call for content ends March 7th at 11:59PM Austin local time (UTC -6).</p>
