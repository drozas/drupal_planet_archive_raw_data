I put this down to some ingenuity and some great preparation. I interrupted two of the people who made it all happen, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/33240">Dan "dman" Morrison</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/user/2640125">Heike "HeikeT" Theis</a> from Wellington, New Zealand, to get to know them better and talk about how they put together the code sprint at DrupalSouth.</p>
