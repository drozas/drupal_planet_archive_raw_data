    <p><a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Developer Days 2014</a> is coming up quick in Szeged, Hungary from March 24th (Mon) to the 30th (Sun) 2014. Szeged, Hungary may sound like it is the middle of nowhere but what do you need to get together with a bunch of Drupal developer friends and learn about and advance the platform together? As those who have been to DrupalCon Europe 2008 in the same city know, Szeged is the ideal place for just that. <a href="http://vimeo.com/75291337">Check out our interviews</a> about those experiences.</p>
<p>Here are some quick facts about Drupal Dev Days 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/program/code-sprints">A whole week of sprints</a> with two core committers (Alex Pott and Nathaniel Catchpole) as well as the testbot system maintainer (Jeremy Thorson) on location! Could we help more to make progress? Oh, most top European Drupal developers are already signed up to come as well!</li>
<li><a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/program/sessions">Three days of sessions and workshops</a> (50 topics providing 56 hours of content). Get lots of readily applicable know-how including website monitoring, e-commerce, practical scrum, Vagrant, product development in real life, Heisencache, IDE tricks and so on. Look into how Drupal is made, see the life of a core maintainer, get gamification tips or discuss a new type of money: Druplicoins!</li>
<li>Want to work on upgrading your modules to Drupal 8 but don't know how? No problem! Additionally to learning about all the new Drupal 8 subsystems, there is a <em>bring-your-own-module</em> workshop  as well, where mentors will help you upgrade your module!</li>
<li>Want to get into Drupal development? Attend the community tools workshop and learn all the tools we use to communicate and work on solutions and learn and enjoy how the Drupal mentoring program works.</li>
</ul>
<p>A truly fantastic opportunity isn't it? Last but not least its also very cheap. <a href="http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/buy-your-ticket">The ticket is only 30 Euros for the whole week</a>! If you want to get to know Drupal 8 or even help make it happen, this is the place to be in March. Note that some cheap hotel deals expire this week. Don't miss out!
