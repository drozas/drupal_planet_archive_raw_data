Features attempts to give you the means to export database-stored site settings in code that you can put into version-control and move from server to server. In Drupal 7 using Features, when you want to make a change to your Drupal site configuration, you would need to either update the feature or make sure that setting was in a feature and (re)create it. When deploying, you would revert your Features so that your site settings match what was in code. If only things were that straight-forward!</p></div></div></div>
