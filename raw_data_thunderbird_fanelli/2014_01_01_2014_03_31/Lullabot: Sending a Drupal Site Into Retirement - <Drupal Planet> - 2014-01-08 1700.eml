    <p>Drupal is a great tool for creating a site. It has lots of modules and functionality that allow you to build interesting and complex features. But sometimes those sites lose their relevancy. It's a site for an event that has passed, for instance. Or a site for a topic that was really important at one time but now is mostly useful as a reference for the content it contains. Or it's a site you just don't have time to keep on top of.</p>
