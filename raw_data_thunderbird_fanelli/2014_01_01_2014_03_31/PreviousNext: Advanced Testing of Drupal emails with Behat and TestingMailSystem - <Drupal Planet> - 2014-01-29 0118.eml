    <div class="field field-name-field-summary field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>One of our recent projects had the following requirements:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users receive points for creating/commenting on content<br /><span style="line-height: 1.4;">When they receive a certain points balance they are awarded some goodies in the mail<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">When they receive the achievement a notification email should be sent to the user and an admin</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting this up with <a href="https://drupal.org/project/userpoints">Userpoints</a>, Userpoints Rules and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a> was fairly straightforward but as part of our Agile processes, the story isn't done until there is automated testing.</p>
<p>Read on to learn how we setup testing the email and their contents using Behat.</p>
