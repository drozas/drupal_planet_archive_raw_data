    <p>Our awesome community recently became a bit more awesome. Drupal was accepted into Google's Summer of Code 2014! Student applications started March 10th and are open until March 21st. It's not too late to become a student, mentor, or submit a project idea. Not available to join the GSoC fun...maybe you can send an email to your alumni university mailing list?</p>
<p>Did you know Drupal recently participated in Google's Code-In contest for high school students aged 13-17 and they contributed over a hundred tasks? For example, did you see the Drupal 8 Theme Cheat Sheet @ <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2145023" title="https://drupal.org/node/2145023">https://drupal.org/node/2145023</a> (desktop background version @ <a href="http://goo.gl/zsQOf1" title="http://goo.gl/zsQOf1">http://goo.gl/zsQOf1</a>) or the Drupal 8 Hello World module video @ <a href="http://youtu.be/N0IFTFQ9VTI" title="http://youtu.be/N0IFTFQ9VTI">http://youtu.be/N0IFTFQ9VTI</a> ? Maybe you recently utilized DrupalLadder.org to find content updated for Drupal 8 by GCI students and watched the video on how to contribute back to the ladder @ <a href="http://drupalladder.org/content/get-involved" title="http://drupalladder.org/content/get-involved">http://drupalladder.org/content/get-involved</a> ? Most importantly it is exciting to note that Drupal gained several Drupal 8 core contributors under the age of 18.</p>
<p>This is a special year as it is the 10th anniversary of Summer of Code and our community is excited to engage in the fun. In an initiative to spark participation, we contacted every single one of Drupal's alumni students along with the mentors of past GSoCs to contribute in the 2014 festivities. As a result Drupal organized almost fifty project ideas from mentors and companies around the world. We filtered the list into just under thirty compelling ideas and submitted a solid application. We're still welcoming project ideas, but we need dedicated mentors to help write applications with students and of course work with them all summer.</p>

<p><strong>Contributing to Drupal</strong></p>
<p>Did you know many successful students started with zero Drupal experience prior to GSoC? If new to Drupal and willing to contribute, come to participate in core contribution mentoring. It helps anyone without any experience to get started with Drupal contribution development. Google wants to see students contributing to organizations prior to the starting of their GSoC project and this is a chance to demonstrate your skills. Office hours provide a chance for students that have problems with their patches or can't find issues to work on to seek guidance. Create an account at <a href="http://drupalmentoring.org" title="http://drupalmentoring.org">http://drupalmentoring.org</a> before you participate in core mentoring. Drupal core contribution office hours are Tuesdays, 02:00 - 04:00 UTC AND Wednesdays, 16:00 - 18:00 UTC. If you need help outside of office hours, join #drupal-contribute to chat with the community members willing to assist 24/7. </p>
