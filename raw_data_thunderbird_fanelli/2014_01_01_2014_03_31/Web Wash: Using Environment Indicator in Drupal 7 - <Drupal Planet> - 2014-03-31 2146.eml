This sort of thing can easily happen when you have 20 tabs opened and forget which site you're currently browsing.</p>

<p>Luckily there's a module you can use to indicate which environment (local, staging, production, etc.) you're currently viewing and it's called <a href="https://drupal.org/project/environment_indicator">Environment Indicator</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/environment_indicator">module</a> helps to separate each environment by displaying a coloured indicator. The indicator itself is fully configurable. You can change its colour, position and text.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create an indicator in two ways: through the module's UI and with some code in <code>settings.php</code>.</p>
