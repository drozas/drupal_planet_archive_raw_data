Most businesses use outdated online approaches to lead generation and sales in what is now a sophisticated digital retail environment. Simply providing product overviews and product order sheets online is no longer enough to make the sale. For the big, high-volume projects supplied by manufacturers, the efficiency of digital tools is invaluable.<br />

<h2>
	Product Customization and Scalability  </h2>
<div>
	Scalability is key for enterprise level organizations with vast inventories and a large client base, in order to execute many large orders successfully. Drupal Commerce is uniquely positioned to streamline the sales experience of a large scale operation on a unified platform, avoiding the pitfalls associated with using a bolt-on store to complete sales. </div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	Manufacturing products, when applied to retail scenarios, often come in an extensive array of variations (sizes, colours, power, speed, etc). Using the Drupal Commerce back-end, each product can be configured for these unique variations using a bulk product creation interface. Product variants are streamlined into a manageable, single product page. This eliminates the need to scroll through an endless catalogue which we often see on older, less optimal sites.<br /><br /><h2>
		Inventory Management</h2>
	<div>
		Drupal Commerce simplifies inventory management and speeds up product creation by providing mechanisms to display a single back-end product in a variety of contexts. In other words, it is easy to reuse a single product and to display it on its own independent product page and in product bundles – no duplication of products required.</div>
	<div>
		 </div>
	<div>
		Products that are often purchased together can be sold in a bundle as a single item. This is especially relevant to the manufacturing industry because many items have associated accessories. Bundles promote intelligent cross-sells. For example, recommending baseboards and moulding to sell with wood flooring.<br />
		 </div>
	<h2>
		Discounting</h2>
	<div>
		Another must have for large retailers is a flexible discounting system. Drupal Commerce uses rules to drive this functionality: website administrators can create a rule that will apply an arbitrary discount on products that match the criteria defined by the rule. For example: discount products tagged with “high performance” by 10%; or discount all products with a SKU starting with XYZ by $5. These rules allow retailers to provide bulk discounts on a large set of items, or on a very granular basis.</div>
	<div>
		 </div>
	<div>
		In conclusion, next level product customization has made manufacturing ecommerce an intuitive next step in streamlining sales systems.</div>
