The national websites for Russia and Turkey are the first ones to be translated! It took less than the standard two weeks - only 5 days to fully implement and translate their sites! The cooperation between the local translator and our technical team was very easy and smooth. The implementation was also successful thanks to well-prepared documentation, translation instructions and optimized technical processes happening in the background and implemented by the Mogdesign team.</p>
<p>The National Website Translation Framework helps to:</p>
<ul><li>Build awareness about the GEW website within a country,</li>
<li>Make GEW more attractive for organizations and sponsors,</li>
<li>Be more understandable for all GEW participants,</li>
<li>Be more connected with national partners.</li>
</ul></div></div></div>
