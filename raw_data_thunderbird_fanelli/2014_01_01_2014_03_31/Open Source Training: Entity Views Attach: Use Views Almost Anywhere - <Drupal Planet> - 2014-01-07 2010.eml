    <p><img style="float: right;" alt="Entity-Views-Attach" src="http://www.ostraining.com/images/drupal/Entity-Views-Attach.jpg" />Entity Views Attach (EVA) is a wonderfully useful Drupal module which makes Views more powerful.</p>
<p>EVA allows you to automatically attach any view to content, comments or terms.</p>
<p>We're going to show you 2 examples of EVA in use. Both of them solve problems that were asked by our members this week. First will see how to sort terms however we want and then we'll see how to add an image for a file download link.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ostrainingdrupal/~4/n076DexC5mk" height="1" width="1"/>
