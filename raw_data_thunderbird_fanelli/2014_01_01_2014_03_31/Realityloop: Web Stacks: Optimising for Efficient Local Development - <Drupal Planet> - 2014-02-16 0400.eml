Over time I&#39;ve tried several options and this presentation is a comparison of several Drupal compatible web stacks.<br />&nbsp;</p><h3>The Presentation</h3><p>I will be presenting &ldquo;<a href="https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/sessions/coding-development/web-stacks-local-development">Web Stacks for Local Development</a>&rdquo; at DrupalSouth 2014 on Sunday the 16th February at 4:00pm (in the Soundings Theatre). The talk will be posted here as soon as the recording is available, but come see me in person if you&rsquo;re attending!<br />&nbsp;</p><h3>What is a Web Stack</h3><p>A web stack is the combination of tools that are required to sever your website to the browser, as Druapl developers these are typically the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Webserver</strong>: Apache, Nginx etc</li><li><strong>Database server</strong>: MySQL, MariaDB, Percona etc</li><li><strong>Application Server</strong>: PHP</li></ul><p>In production it may also include a caching layer such as Varnish, but you usually wouldn&rsquo;t want that in your dev environment.</p><p>I believe there are efficiency benefits to be had by choosing carefully the web stack you use for local development which is why I decided to do a presentation about it at Drupal South today.</p><p>Throughout the presentation I compared several 1 click installers, and some more advanced setups to show that you can save time during development using the tool that is right for you.</p><p>For those that didn&rsquo;t have time to grab a screenshot of of the links describing solutions to some of the issues that I highlighted they are included below.<br />&nbsp;</p><h3>Links from the presentation</h3><h4>Acquia Dev Desktop</h4><p>Acquia Dev Desktop doesn&rsquo;t work so well on windows, I&rsquo;ve documented how to improve things at:</p><ul><li><a href="http://rl.cm/addwinfix">rl.cm/addwinfix</a></li></ul><h4>OSX Aegir Installer</h4><p>The OSX Aegir Installer script that I created can be found at:</p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/BrianGilbert/OSXAegirInstaller">github.com/BrianGilbert/OSXAegirInstaller</a></li></ul><h4>Hosts Management</h4><p>We don&rsquo;t like having Drupal running under subdirectories of a single site, so we use wildcard DNS so that we can create a vhost entry for each site and access it without having to manually edit the hosts file on our laptops</p><ul><li><strong>OS X &amp; *nix</strong> - <a href="http://rl.cm/dnsmasq">rl.cm/dnsmasq</a></li><li><strong>Windows</strong> - <a href="http://rl.cm/winhosts">rl.cm/winhosts</a> &amp; <a href="http://rl.cm/wincfg">rl.cm/wincfg</a></li></ul><h4>Cron Setup</h4><p>So that Drupal can run scheduled tasks it&rsquo;s best that you have cron configured here are the Drupal documentation pages for doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>OS X and *nix</strong> - <a href="http://dgo.to/23714">dgo.to/23714</a></li><li><strong>Windows</strong> - <a href="http://dgo.to/31506">dgo.to/31506</a></li></ul><h4>Configuration Management Tools</h4><p>Once you start going down the virtualisation route you&rsquo;ll likely want to automate setup of the virtual machine, you can use any of the following configuration management tools:</p><ul><li><a href="http://ansible.com">ansible.com</a></li><li><a href="http://getchef.com">getchef.com</a></li><li><a href="http://puppetlabs.com">puppetlabs.com</a></li><li><a href="http://saltstack.com">saltstack.com</a></li></ul></div><div class="field field-name-field-tags">drupal planetdrupal</div>
