Recently, I've been working on a new learning series and set up Vagrant for local development. Both experiences left me thinking "Ugh!" It requires so much work just to start working!

Read on if you're interested in taking a peek at Drupal 8 without the setup overhead. I've got just the tool you've been looking for.</p>
