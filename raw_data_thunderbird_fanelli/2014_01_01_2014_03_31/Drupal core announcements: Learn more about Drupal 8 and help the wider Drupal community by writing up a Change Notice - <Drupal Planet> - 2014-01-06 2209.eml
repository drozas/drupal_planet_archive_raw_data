    <p>A happy 2014! What a great year for a Drupal major release!</p>
<p>Have you started learning the new Drupal 8 APIs? Are you porting your modules forward to an 8.x branch? Are you a curious site builder ready to adopt the new hotness that will be Drupal 8?</p>
<p>Well now is the time to jump in and start learning. And one of the best ways to learn is to teach. Speaking from experience, authoring a <a href="/freelinking/https%3A/%252Fdrupal.org/list-changes%20" class="freelinking"> change notice</a> is an excellent way to explore a sub-system of Drupal 8. You are, in a sense, documenting your personal learning as you work to understand the change, why the change was necessary and how users will write code against the new system. And everyone benefits from your efforts.</p>
<p>What is a change notice? Well, when a significant change is made to Drupal, the developers and committers will require that a change notice node be published that describes the updated code and if applicable, how the change alters a previously existing API. We have a detailed explanation of <a href="/freelinking/https%3A/%252Fdrupal.org/contributor-tasks/draft-change-notification" class="freelinking"> how to write a change notice</a>. Generally, you will spend 20 to 40 minutes on this task.  Here is the current list of <a href="/freelinking/https%3A/%252Fdrupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal%3Ftext%3Dchange%2520notice%2526amp%3Bstatus%5B0%5D%3D1%2526amp%3Bversion%5B0%5D%3D8.x%2526amp%3Bissue_tags_op%3D%253D%2526amp%3Bissue_tags%3DNeeds%2520change%2520notification%2526amp%3Bassigned%3D%2526amp%3Bsubmitted%3D%2526amp%3Bparticipant%3D%2526amp%3B%2526amp%3B%2526amp%3B%2526amp%3Border%3Dfield_issue_priority%2526amp%3Bsort%3Ddesc%20" class="freelinking"> issues that require a Change Notice</a>.  Right now there are about 40 issues that require a notification to be written.</p>
<p>Very often the developers involved with an issue patch will author the change notice. When this does not happen, the issue is marked with a <code>Needs change notification</code> tag. Any open change notices will <a href="/freelinking/https%3A/%252Fdrupal.org/node/2078085%20" class="freelinking"> block the creation of a Drupal release candidate</a>, so they must all eventually get written. Change notices are a vital means to help Drupal developers understand how to alter their coding practice from Drupal 7 to 8.</p>
<p>If we got 40 people to each pick an issue and write up a change notice, we could clear out the queue today! That's quite an achievable goal.</p>
