The dead giveaways are the buttons and navigation, but it doesn't have to be this way.</p>

<p>If you want to change the look and feel of your Bootstrap site then take a look at <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>. It offers 12 great looking themes, and best of all they are free and <a href="https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch">open source</a>.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use a <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> theme in two ways.
