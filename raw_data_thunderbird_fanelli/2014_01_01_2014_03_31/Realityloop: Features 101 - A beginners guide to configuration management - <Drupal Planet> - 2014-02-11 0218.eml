One of the earliest, memorable sites I worked on was a large community content driven site, which introduced me to the issues of &ldquo;Deployment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Configuration Management&rdquo;, although I didn&rsquo;t know them by those names at that time, all I knew was this; making configuration changes to a production site without losing data can be a pain in the butt.</p><p>And the reason that was was that I, like many others, was up to that point using a simple yet dangerous deployment strategy, I was developing my new functionality/configuration on a local development site and then replacing the production database with the local version. And while that approach may work in a lot of cases, if there is any content being created or important data being collected in the production database, then you&rsquo;re going to have a bad time.</p><p>However, I was thrown into this issue headfirst, and I came up with a better approach that worked for me&hellip; running the production and local database throw a diff/merge application.</p><p>I never wish that process upon anyone, it was slow and painful. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it worked, and I learnt a lot about the Drupal 6 database structure from that experience&hellip; but it&rsquo;s not an advisable approach.</p><p>Later in my Drupal career, during a community driven collaborative site build, while dealing with the similar problem of having multiple developers wanting to make configuration changes without stepping on each others toes, I was introduced to Features. At this time, I was using a hook_update_N() based approach for deployment, and Features didn&rsquo;t appear to me at first as being all that necessary&hellip; how wrong I was.</p><p>To this day, I could not consider building a site without Features, and over the years at Drupal meet ups and events I have repeatedly said that someone really needs to do an introductory type talk on Features, it&rsquo;s always somewhat assumed that people should be used or mentioned as an aside, and yet so often I find that so many out there don&rsquo;t see the need for it. This year at, Drupal South 2014, I decided to take my own advice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The presentation</h3><p>I will be presenting (or have already presented) &ldquo;<a href="https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/sessions/site-building/features-101-beginners-guide-configuration-management-featured">Features 101: A beginners guide to Configuration Management</a>&rdquo; at <a href="https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz">DrupalSouth 2014</a> on Saturday the 15th at 12:30pm (room TBA). The talk will be posted (if possible) here (or has already been), but come see me in person if you&rsquo;re attending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Following along</h3><p>The following distribution was made specifically for the talk, so if you&rsquo;d like to follow along and learn how to use Features yourself you can build your own copy using Drush with the following command:</p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">drush make https://raw.github.com/Realityloop/Features101/7.x-1.x/stub.make features101</code></span><p>Once built, install as per a standard Drupal site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The tutorial</h3><p>Time permitting, a tutorial-esque version of the talk will be posted here, but no spoilers up front :)</p></div><div class="field field-name-field-tags">drupal planetdrupalpresentationfeatures</div>
