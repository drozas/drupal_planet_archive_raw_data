So Peter, what's your role at Mediacurrent, both internally and client-related?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I am a "Drupal Developer", so I take care of site builds, writing custom modules, consulting on how to accomplish clients' goals, and a bit of theming here and there.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. We're so glad to have you! &nbsp;Give us an idea of what professional path brought you here.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I got started with computer programming when I was in high school, then was exposed to Web development right after. With the exception of a few side-quests, this is what I've been doing ever since.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. How did you first get involved with Drupal?</strong></p>
