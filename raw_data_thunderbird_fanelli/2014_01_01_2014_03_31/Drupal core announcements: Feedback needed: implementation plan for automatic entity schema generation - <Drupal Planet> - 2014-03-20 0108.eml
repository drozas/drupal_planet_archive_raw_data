    <p>We have an open <a href="https://drupal.org/comment/8552811">critical beta blocker issue</a> that aims to make the entity storage controller able to automatically generate the entity schema for all defined fields.</p>
<p>An initial implementation plan was laid out in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5BLd-KmrLnJW88SdLX5HG3Xm7AyinxwXNAGvQY9C0Y/edit?pli=1#">Prague</a> (see section Unify Field storage).

<p>Feedback is badly needed so that I don't waste a full week of sprint time working on something that might not be good enough (or at all).</p>
