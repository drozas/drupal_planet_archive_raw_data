<p>Our last summit was at Droplabs in January, 2013, and half a dozen Greater Los Angeles Area companies offering Drupal services were represented. This time, we're partnering with GLADCamp and are having our summit at the Hilton Pasadena &amp; Convention Center on Friday, March 7th.</p>
<h3>About the Employers Summit</h3>
<p>This event is a roll-up-your-sleeves working meeting for companies and organizations who use and depend on Drupal, as well as its healthy business community and marketplace. We'll be meeting one another (many for the first time) and discussing the following topics:</p>
<ul><li>Building a healthy marketplace of colleagues and potential partners;</li>
<li>Getting the most out of our recruiting and marketing dollar;</li>
<li>What we're doing now to staff up, from local recruiting and in-house training to outsourcing and hiring out-of-town or overseas;</li>
<li>Identifying the skills, job titles and qualifications of desirable candidates, employees and vendors;</li>
<li>Workshops, trainings and other programs that most or all of us can get behind in order to solve our business needs.</li>
</ul><h3>How to Qualify to Attend</h3>
<p>This is a a private event and those who qualify to attend include sponsors of GLADCamp 2014, any of the exhibiting companies of the Drupal job fairs we've had in Los Angeles, and any companies and organizations who have hosted Drupal meetups, trainings or other Drupal community events.</p>
<p>Being a GLADCamp sponsor qualifies you for this event. Hosting a meetup at your office qualifies you for this event. Buying pizza at a meetup, while appreciated, does not. If you do not meet the above qualifications, you can <a href="https://drupal.la/2014/contact">contact us</a> with a request to attend.</p>
