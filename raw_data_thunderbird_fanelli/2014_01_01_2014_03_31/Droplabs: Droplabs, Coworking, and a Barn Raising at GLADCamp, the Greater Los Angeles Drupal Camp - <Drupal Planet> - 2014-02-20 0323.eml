    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Hot on the heels of exhibiting (and presenting on <a href="//droplabs.net/news/join-us-at-scale-12x-the-southern-california-linux-expo">how we built Droplabs</a>) at this week's SCALE 12x conference, we'll be at <a href="https://gladcamp.org">GLADCamp</a>, the Greater Los Angeles Drupal Camp, March 7, 9, 2014. </p>
<p>We've been brought on board as one of the media sponsors of the conference and are joining <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/sponsor/drupal-watchdog">Drupal Watchdog</a> and <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/sponsor/pasadena-media">Pasadena Media</a> at that sponsorship level. Come over to our booth and learn more about coworking, our awesome programs and services, and to find out why Droplabs was recognized last year as the <a href="//droplabs.net/news/droplabs-recognized-as-worlds-top-drupal-location">Top Drupal Location</a> in the world. You can also sign up for a chance to win one of our 1-month coworking passes!</p>
<p>One of the big events our group is organizing at GLADCamp is the <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/barn-raising">community barn raising</a> to benefit a local 501c3 non-profit on March 9, 2014. Lee Vodra and Christefano Reyes, two of the Droplabs founders, will be presenting on <a href="//droplabs.net/programs/coders-with-a-cause">Coders with a Cause</a> and <a href="https://gladcamp.org/2014/session/community-barn-raisings-drupal-for-good-in-action">how we run our barn raisings</a> to harness the good will and technical skills of our amazing community to build websites for non-profits in intense one- or two-day sprints.</p>
<p>If you're reading this and represent a coworking space, send us some brochures or coworking vouchers for your space and we'll spread the word to everyone at the conference. Droplabs believes strongly in the values of coworking and offering services to small businesses, freelancers and remote workers, and the fascinating things that can happen when combining these values with the values of open source software and community.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
