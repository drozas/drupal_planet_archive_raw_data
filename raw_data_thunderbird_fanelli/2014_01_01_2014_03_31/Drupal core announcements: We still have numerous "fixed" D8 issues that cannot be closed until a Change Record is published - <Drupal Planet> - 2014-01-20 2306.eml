    <p>Two weeks ago I <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/394113">wrote</a> that we had 40 "fixed" issues that cannot be closed until a <a href="https://drupal.org/list-changes">change record</a> is published for them.  That number now stands at <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status[0]=Open&amp;priorities[0]=400&amp;priorities[1]=300&amp;version[0]=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=Needs%20change%20notification&amp;text=&amp;assigned=&amp;submitted=&amp;participant=&amp;&amp;&amp;order=field_issue_priority&amp;sort=desc">39 issues</a> as a result of churn from a few change records being written and a couple new issues fixed and tagged for a change record.</p>
<p>We have documentation about <a href="https://drupal.org/contributor-tasks/draft-change-notification">how to write a change record</a> if you have not written one before.</p>
<p>If you start a change record and feel that you need input from the original issue authors, you can use the original issue queue to work out a draft just like <a href="https://drupal.org/user/824780">jgSnell</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/412171">SebCorbin</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/user/1167326">Cottser</a> are doing in <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1649780">Remove first/last/odd/even classes in favor of CSS3 pseudo selectors</a>.</p>
<p>Today is a great day to become involved with getting Drupal 8 to a stable release.</p>
