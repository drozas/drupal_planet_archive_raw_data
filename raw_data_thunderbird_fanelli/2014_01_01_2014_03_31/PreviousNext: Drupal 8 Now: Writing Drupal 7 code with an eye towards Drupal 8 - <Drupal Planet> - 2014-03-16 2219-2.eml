<p>Those of us who went through the Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 release know what I'm talking about. Do I build it on Drupal 6 or do I chance it on Drupal 7 and work through any missing modules.</p>
<p>We're not there yet for Drupal 8, but we already have customers asking us to develop Drupal 7 sites in a fashion <em>sympathetic</em> to Drupal 8.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? Well we have a few pointers on starting new Drupal 7 modules that will be easier to upgrade to Drupal 8 when the time comes. We'll present these in a new <i>Drupal 8 Now! </i>series of blog posts.</p>
