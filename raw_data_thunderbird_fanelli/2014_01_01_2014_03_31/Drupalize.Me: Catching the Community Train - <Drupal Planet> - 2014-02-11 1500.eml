How do you add value and contribute to something that already has so much community involvement, innovation, and growth? It’s easy to feel like you're trying to catch a runaway train. I feel like this is especially true for designers who want to get involved or even just learn about what is already happening.<br />
 <br />
I am new to Drupal. In fact, I barely ever heard of Drupal before I was fortunate enough to join the Drupalize.Me team as an interactive designer. And I may never have appreciated this amazing community if it weren't for my incredible colleagues—each of whom promotes contribution and collaboration. The absence of a similar experience could hold back many talented designers who might bring great new insights to the Drupal community. Not every designer has the advantage of working for Drupalize.Me, but I believe every designer relishes the idea of making a positive impact with his/her knowledge and skills. So how do designers get involved and not feel like they're trying to catch that runaway train?<br />
