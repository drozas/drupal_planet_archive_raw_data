    <p>As a Drupal themer, we're often tasked with building multiple sites concurrently. One site may be a new build from scratch, and another could be a site built two years ago that is getting a new feature. If they utilize Sass in the theme, then they both have one thing in common:</p><br />
<br />
<p><i>They have Ruby gem dependencies.</i></p><br />
<br />
<p>What are they chances that both sites use the same versions of the same gems? Slim? None? Ever tried to build a set of Sass files when you don't have the correct gem versions installed? Oh what a pain.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Let's take the pain away with a few simple techniques.</p><br />
<br />
<h2>Ruby and RVM</h2><br />
<br />
<p>OS X comes with Ruby built-in, but I highly recommend installing Ruby with <a href="http://rvm.io">RVM</a>. With RVM, you can specify the version of Ruby you want installed, plus a whole lot more. <a href="http://rvm.io/rvm/install/">Installation instructions</a> are available, but are outside the scope of this blog post.</p>
