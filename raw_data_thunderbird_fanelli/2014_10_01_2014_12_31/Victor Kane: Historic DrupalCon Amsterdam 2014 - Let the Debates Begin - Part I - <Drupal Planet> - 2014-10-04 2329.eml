    <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I really think that a debate needs to continue around&nbsp;<a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/keynote-dries-buytaert" target="_blank">Keynote: Dries Buytaert</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of understanding the forces at work competing for the future of Drupal and indeed all open source projects. Leaving to one side without comment the really weird Dries&nbsp;<em>doppelganger</em>&nbsp;designed somehow to elevate the image of one of the sponsors, it was indeed saluted by many as being very special. A glance at the&nbsp;<a href="http://handpickedtweets.com/#/label/dries-keynote" target="_blank">tweets feed for the keynote</a>, for example, (or&nbsp;<a href="http://production.seen.co/event/drupalcon-amsterdam-2014-amsterdam-rai-amsterdam-netherlands-2014-1397/search/dries" target="_blank">this one</a>) were by and large ecstatic, and many interpreted the talk as exceedingly progressive. "The power of the people"... #digitaldisruption... "This is @Dries most socialist #Driesnote ever." "Applause even in the overflow room..." "Most relevant and interesting #DriesNote in a long time. Well done..." "Exciting. The best Dries keynote ever."</p>
