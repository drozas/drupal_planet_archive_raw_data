On december 12 the <a href-"http://stichtingdrupal.nl">Dutch Drupal Foundation</a> will organise the first edition of the "<a href="http://splashawards.org/">SplashAwards</a>". This award is to put outstanding projects in the spotlight, the best Drupal projects and community contributions from Belgium and The Netherlands. </p>
<p>Both Drupal agencies and individuals who have achieved extraordinary results get special recognition from inside and outside the Drupal community. The international jury selects winners out of hundreds of contestants in several categories including best government project and best Drupal theme. </p>
<p>The jury includes well known people in the broader PHP and Drupal community from all around the world:  Joost de Valk (SEO WP fame) , Moshe Weitzman (contributor since 2001), Jeffrey "jam" McGuire (evangelist with a mo), Holly Ross (Executive Director  DA) , Morten Birch Heide-Jorgensen (enfant terrible and good friend :-)), Stefan Koopmanschap (PHP / Symfony guru from the Netherlands) , Guido Jansen (magento fame) and Robert Douglass (SOLR fame and most of all around friendly chap) will select the ten winners who will walk home along the canals with a great award and a smiling face.</p>
<p>There are 10 awards to be given, from architecture and commerce to best governmental site and theme. The award self will be held for some 100 people, in an <a href="http://uitkijk.nl/zaalhuur/">old cinema</a>  in the centre of Amsterdam. We are really looking forward to this event. And in fact, it will be the last event of the year for the Dutch and a great year it has been. </p>
