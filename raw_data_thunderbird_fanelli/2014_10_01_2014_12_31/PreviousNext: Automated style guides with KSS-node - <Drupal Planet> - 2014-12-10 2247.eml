    <p>During PreviousNext’s weekly developers meeting I recently gave a lightning talk about how to use <a href="https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node">kss-node</a> to auto-generate a website style guide. If you’ve even tangentially followed front-end development, you’ll find that this is yet-another blog post describing “project A implementing technology B with hip, new language/framework C.”</p>
<p>But kss-node <em>is</em> really cool and useful, especially if you understand how it fits into the larger picture of <strong>the new web development</strong> process. Fortunately, my <a href="https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/style-guide-driven-development-new-web-development">previous post</a> provides that big picture, so if you’d like to understand how Agile is turning web development inside-out and how style-guide-driven development is the new website development workflow, please go read that first. Then head back here for the screencast to get you started with kss-node.</p>
