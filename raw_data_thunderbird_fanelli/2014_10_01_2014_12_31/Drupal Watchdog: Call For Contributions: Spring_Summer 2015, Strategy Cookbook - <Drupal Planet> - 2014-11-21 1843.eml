              <p>As Drupal Watchdog approaches its fifth year of publication, we’re sending out a call for contributions to our upcoming <em>Spring/Summer 2015</em> issue. Guided by helpful feedback from our readers, I’m excited to announce that our next issue will be a <em>Strategy Cookbook</em>. What does that mean? I’m glad you asked…</p>
<p>Anyone that has spent any time with Drupal knows that it is a very flexible tool. And while flexibility is wonderfully powerful, it can also be wickedly complex. Whether you’re a business owner or product owner, site builder or developer, a site maintainer or a project manager, a business strategist or analyst, a themer or a systems administrator, a designer or a student, you have certainly struggled with complexity around Drupal.</p>
<p>This next issue of Drupal Watchdog aims to document a variety of useful strategies for navigating this complexity in all of its forms. We are looking for useful recipes, case studies, tips, and tricks for how to best leverage Drupal to solve strategic business problems.</p>
<p>We are looking for articles on <em>Content Strategy</em>: the analyzing, sorting, constructing, placing and managing of content on a web site. Why are people visiting your website, what is the content they’re interested in, and how can you assure them a meaningful experience? What contributed modules and configuration choices do you use to support your content strategy?</p>
<p>We’re looking for articles on <em>Business Strategy</em>: how stakeholders set goals and objectives that take into account available resources, competition, and the entire business environment. Are there key questions that need to be asked, specific to using Drupal? How does a business adapt to meet the changing landscape?</p>
<p>We’re looking for articles that help readers differentiate the forest from the trees, focusing on value. We’re looking for explorations of the role of analytics in evaluating content and deployment strategy. And we’re looking for examples of organizational and business problems that Drupal is good at solving.</p>
<p>Our <em>Strategy Cookbook</em> will be this and much more: please email me at <a href="mailto:jeremy@drupalwatchdog.com">jeremy@drupalwatchdog.com</a> with proposals for what you’d like to write for this next issue of Drupal Watchdog!</p>

<p>We will require a rough draft of your contribution and any supporting materials by Monday, February 2nd, 2015. We must receive the final draft (including all images, tables, code snippets, etc) by February 16th, 2015. </p>
