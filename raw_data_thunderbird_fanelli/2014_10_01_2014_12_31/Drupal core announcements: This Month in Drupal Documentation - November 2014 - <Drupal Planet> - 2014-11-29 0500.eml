    <p>Here's an update from the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">Documentation Working Group (DocWG)</a> on what has been happening in Drupal Documentation in the last month or so. Sorry... because this is posted in the Core group as well as Documentation, comments are disabled.</p>
<p>If you have comments or suggestions, please see the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">DocWG home page</a> for how to contact us. Thanks!</p>
<h3>Notable Documentation Updates</h3>
<p>Work continues to progress on the <a href="http://drupal.org/theme-guide/8">Drupal 8 Theming Guide</a>, and providing better documentation of the release policies for Drupal 8 and future versions of Drupal has been a topic of much discussion recently. In general, documentation for Drupal 8 continues to get better as more and more people start making use of the current beta version and are ironing out the details.</p>
<p>If you're interested in helping out with documentation now is a great opportunity to install Drupal 8 and walk through the documentation related to various tasks and verify that it's clear, concise and accurate.</p>
<p>There was also a considerable amount of work put into updating various handbook pages for the Chart module, the Charts module, and various other Drupal charting solutions. This demonstrates one of my favorite ways to get involved with documentation. When you're working on a project that requires you to do some research into a module you've never used before take some time to jot down a few notes about what you've learned, or to help improve existing documentation. It doesn't take long to do and if nothing else your future self will probably thank you for the work you did next time you come across this same problem.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">DocWG home page</a> for how to contact us, if you'd like to be listed here in our next post!</p>
<h3>Thanks for contributing!</h3>
<p>Since Oct. 28th, 2014 (<a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/447693">our previous TMIDD post</a>), 260 contributors have made 1135 total Drupal.org documentation page revisions, including 6 people that made more than 30 edits (Pierre.Vriens, kreynen, tvn, annagaz, peterx, and ashish_nirmohi) -- thanks everyone!</p>
<p>In addition, there were many many commits to Drupal Core and contributed projects that improved documentation -- these are hard to count, because many commits combine code and documentation -- but they are greatly appreciated too!</p>
<h3>Documentation Priorities</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/priorities">Current documentation priorities page</a> is always a good place to look to figure out what to work on, and has been updated recently.</p>
<p>If you're new to contributing to documentation, these projects may seem a bit overwhelming -- so why not try out a <a href="https://drupal.org/contributor-tasks/writers">New contributor task</a> to get started?</p>
<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/447258">Global Sprint Weekend</a> is coming up soon, and if you haven't done so already now would be a great time to find some other people that are interested in sprinting on documentation issues and make plans to get together.</li>
<li>Although we don't have anything specific lined up at the moment DrupalCon Bogot√† (Feb. 10-12) and DrupalCon LA (May 11-15) are both coming up soon and there will undoubtably be talk about documentation at both.
</li><li>
</li><li>Got any events you know about that we should add to this list? Let us know!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Report from the Working Group</h3>
<p>At our last meeting on Oct. 28th, the Documentation Working Group discussed possible options for curated documentation on Drupal.org and what it would take to make that happen, as well as what the potential downsides might be. In general, we're in favor of the idea but realize that doing so will require putting a lot of thought into making it sustainable. We'll continue to discuss this in future meetings and are open to suggestions. We also discussed options for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2206371">better handling of SPAM documentation pages</a>, and a somewhat mysterious <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/944332">documentation search block</a> that shows up on a few pages and how to proceed with that.</p>
<p>Right now, figuring out how to best proceed with hook_help() and getting it updated for Drupal 8 are on our radar and likely to be a topic of conversation at our next meeting.</p>
<p>Finally, our next meeting will be December 17th. We normally meet using Google Hangouts; if you'd like to join us, <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/user/6005">contact Boris (batigolix)</a>.</p>
