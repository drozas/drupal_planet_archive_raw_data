<p>            On Feb. 11, 2014, Drupal.org – flagship site of the Drupal project – joined thousands of other websites in a campaign against state Internet surveillance dubbed “The Day We Fight Back.”</p>
<p>            In announcing Drupal.org participation in the campaign, leading Drupal developer Larry Garfield made a strong link between free software and digital freedom: “Both the American and British governments have been found violating the digital privacy of millions of people in their own countries and around the world. That is exactly the sort of attack on individual digital sovereignty that Free Software was created to combat.”</p>
<p>            What are the implications of recent surveillance revelations for Drupal site owners? What can and should Drupal site builders and developers be doing to protect user privacy? To find out, I spoke with analysts and developers both within and outside the Drupal community.</p>
<h3>User Data and Threat Modeling</h3>
<p>            “Contemporary websites have almost innumerable places where information can be entered, logged, and accessed, by either the first party or third parties.”</p>
<p>            That’s the frank assessment of Chris Parsons, a postdoctoral fellow at The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. Parsons’ current research focus is on state access to telecommunications data, through both overt mechanisms and signals intelligence – covert surveillance.</p>
<p>            Parsons recommends an approach to user data protection called threat modeling. “So who are you concerned about, what do you believe your ethical duties of care are, and then how do you both defend against your perceived attackers and apply your duty of care?”</p>
<p>            Parsons suggests, “The first step is really just information inventory: what’s collected, why, where’s it going, for how long.”</p>        </div>
