<img src="http://www.ross.ws/sites/default/files/articles/Drupal%20Night%20Before%20Christmas/Druplicon%20with%20Santa%20hat.png" /><p>'Twas the night before Christmas, here at the North Pole,<br />
and I feared our big deadline was a hopeless goal.</p>

<p>Our long lists of boys and girls, and addresses too,<br />
were now vexing to manage — a redo overdue!</p>

<p>The data were buried in a mess of spreadsheets,<br />
and the elves were crying "Help!" in emails and tweets.</p>

<p>They cursed and they swore when Excel crashed once more.<br />
(So a mansion in Redmond I vowed to ignore.)</p>

<p>When outside the workshop there arose an odd noise,<br />
I waddled from my old desk with more hope than poise.</p>

<p>Out in the snow was parked a snazzy flying car<br />
with shiny blue paint that reflected the North Star.</p>

<p>The driver emerged and my dark worries did cease<br />
because I knew right away it must be "Saint Dries".</p>

<p>I welcomed them all — a team led by the tall gent<br />
with spiky hair-icicles and Belgian accent.</p>

<p>I told them our sad tale of a data nightmare,<br />
of flat files, scattered papers, and flaky software.</p>

<p>The content mismanagement was too much to bear,<br />
but they assured my poor staff we need not despair.</p>

<p>"Replace that tangle of one-off utilities<br />
with a website using Drupal's abilities."</p>

<p>They spoke no more praise but began working like mad,<br />
and soon produced wireframes that looked totally rad.</p>

<p>They chose modules with care, these downloads they came.<br />
The team typed happily as they called them by name:<br />
"Now Token and then Rules!<br />
Next Views and CTools!<br />
Then JQuery Update!<br />
Plus Backup and Migrate!<br />
>From Drupal.org,<br />
download and install!<br />
Add them to the website!<br />
Enable them all!"</p>

<p>We gave them plenty of our taxonomy tags,<br />
such as "toys" and "dolls" and "coal" and "bags".</p>

<p>The cool website they built would surely save the day,<br />
and cookies and milk is all they asked for in pay.</p>

<p>They left in their car, like a streaking water drop,<br />
when its flux capacitor gave a thunderous pop.</p>

<p>And I heard them exclaim as they faded from sight,<br />
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a Drupal night!"</p>
