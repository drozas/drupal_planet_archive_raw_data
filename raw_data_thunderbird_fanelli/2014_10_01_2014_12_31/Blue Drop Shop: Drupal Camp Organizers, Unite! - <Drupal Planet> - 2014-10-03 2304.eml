I think we pulled four banquet tables together in order to fit everyone.</p>
<p>The purpose was to share pain points and just brainstorm camp stuff. Notes were taken and the doc is shared publicly here: <a href="http://bit.ly/drupal-camps">http://bit.ly/drupal-camps</a></p>
<p>Most of the discussion was centered around information sharing and coordination of efforts and how to accomplish that. We had thought that creating a private group on g.d.o for organizers to share not-ready-for-prime-time information would work. Turns out, that's not the case, as "private" only means there is moderation on who can join, but all posts are fully public.</p>
<p>Why a private group? Well, mostly for shared contact lists, proposed dates for coordinated planning before announcements, things like that. The intent also is to publicly share as much knowledge as we can, but in a centralized place that's a little less cumbersome than g.d.o.</p>
<p>In addition, we created a #drupalcamp IRC channel, and you should totally join if you are a camp organizer.Â </p>
<p>So stay tuned, add your name to the doc if you want to be included on the proposed quarterly meeting, and join the channel so collaboration can start now!</p>
