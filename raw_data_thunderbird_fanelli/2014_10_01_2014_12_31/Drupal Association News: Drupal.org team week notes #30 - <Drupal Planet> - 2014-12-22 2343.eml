<h2>Responsive Drupal.org</h2>
<p>As a New Year’s present to all Drupal.org visitors, today we deployed the initial responsive version of Bluecheese theme. This means that Drupal.org will now look much better on small and large screens. Drupal.org subsites on Drupal 7, such as Api.Drupal.org and Assoc.Drupal.org, will follow as they are tested.</p>
<p>The work on responsifying the theme <a href="”https://assoc.drupal.org/content/drupalorg-team-week-notes-23-drupal-dev-days-szeged”">started at Drupal Dev Days in Szeged</a> earlier this year, with the final testing happening during BadCamp in November.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank our wonderful volunteers for making this happen:<br /><a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/751964&quot;">LewisNyman</a>,  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/dasjo">dasjo</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/emma.maria">emma.maria</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mallezie">mallezie</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/manuel-garcia">Manuel Garcia</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/sqndr">sqndr</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/thamas">thamas</a>.</p>
<p>This is the initial deployment, though more page-by-page improvements will be coming. Drupal.org is a big site, with lots of pages that will need specific mobile-first design changes.</p>
<h2>Improved user profiles</h2>
<p><img class="right" width="240px" src="https://assoc.drupal.org/files/mentors.png" />During the last few months we’ve been slowly migrating user profile fields to Field API fields, which gives us more flexibility to improve profile pages. While migrating the fields, we started to rearrange layout of user profiles. A lot more work will happen on layouts now that field migration is complete, but even now you can see that profiles look much better.</p>
<p>One particular change which happened during fields migration is the ‘My mentors’ field layout. Previous it was just a list of blue links, but now we actually show user pictures of mentors.</p>
<h2>New database servers</h2>
<p>Drupal.org’s database servers were due for a hardware refresh. New hardware was purchased, provisioned and deployed for Drupal.org that has improved page response times across the site. The new hardware brings solid state drives, and quadruples the amount of processors and memory.</p>

As always, we’d like to say thanks to all volunteers who are working with us and to the Drupal Association <a href="https://drupal.org/supporters">Supporters</a>, who made it possible for us to work on these projects. </p>
