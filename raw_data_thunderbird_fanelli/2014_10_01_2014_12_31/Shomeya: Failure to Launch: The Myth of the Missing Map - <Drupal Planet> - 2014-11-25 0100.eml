We always think we need something more, that missing set of instructions or special ingredient that will propel us to finish. That special person, few moments of sanity, or foolproof plan.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, while those things may encourage us to make the choice to take action or bring balance and clarity, they never change the fact that we won&#39;t make it anywhere until we start the journey. We could be waiting at the bus stop thinking it&#39;s the only way we&#39;ll get there, when the whole time we could have been on the train.</p>
