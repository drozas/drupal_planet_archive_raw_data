          <div class="field-item"><p>Drupal is not only a content management framework to build awesome websites! It is way more than that. Behind the technical part of Drupal are the most creative, savvy and kind people I have ever met. Those people-from all over the world-form one of the most active and powerful open source communities around the web.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-center align-center" data-editor-file-uuid="64220c80-0646-4c1f-b500-e3ef6483f3c7" height="847" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/15213449757_a76275950a_k.jpg" width="600" /><p>To fully experience the community it is not enough to participate in the issue queue, commit patches and help others out. Have you ever wondered who is behind "The mother ship" or who created your favourite module? If you want to find out, you have to get active and visit one of the many Drupal Camps or Cons which are being organised around the world.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-centeralign-center align-center align-center" data-editor-file-uuid="3855c1dc-5337-4685-b103-03164d2c12e3" height="1365" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/15205243869_1af4076de8_k.jpg" width="600" /><p>You might run into <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick" target="_blank">Angie Byron</a> (aka webchick), <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/76919" target="_blank">Jeffrey A. McGuire</a> (aka "jam" or as I call him Mr. Moustache), <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mortendk" target="_blank">Morten Birch</a> (aka the King of the North, creator of the mother ship), <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/fubhy" target="_blank">Sebastian Siemmsen</a> (aka fubhy, maintainer of the Omega theme and creator of the widely loved Omega 4 theme) and you might even have an encounter with <a href="http://buytaert.net/" target="_blank">Dries Buytaert</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="align-center align-center" data-editor-file-uuid="584fc127-c1a2-429d-be00-cffd9c05f0d0" height="1365" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/15385840626_82d23d5a09_k.jpg" width="600" /><img alt="" class="align-center align-center" data-editor-file-uuid="2fd5ee59-4e30-4c82-8551-81164cb2d5f0" height="1365" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/11067345555_e145acacaf_k.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>At Camps and Cons you have plenty of opportunities to engage and connect with others, share know-how, present your module or contribute to core in many different ways. Even summarising an issue in the queue helps a lot.</p>

It is also the people behind the scenes. It's about (new) friends and friendship. It's about taking part in a great community. So go on and save the date for the next Drupal Camp or the <a href="https://losangeles2015.drupal.org/" target="_blank">DrupalCon 2015 in Los Angeles</a>.</p></div>
