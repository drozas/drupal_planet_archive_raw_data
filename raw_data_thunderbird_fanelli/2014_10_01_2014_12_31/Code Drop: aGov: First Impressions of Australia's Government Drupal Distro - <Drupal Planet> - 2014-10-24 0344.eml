It is </span>built and maintained by the Australian Drupal shop PreviousNext. The distribution is a foundation for websites built for <a href="https://codedrop.com.au/drupal-government">government organisations</a>. At Code Drop we've been involved in the development of websites for government bodies locally in WA, however it is an area that is forecast to expand significantly and one that all Drupal agencies should be embracing.</p>
<p>The first step to undertaking the technical aspect of a large project is to evaluate all of the code in the Drupal ecosystem for appropriateness and stability. In this post we’ll go through some of the features found in aGov (7.x-1.x) and how they could be applied to a new government website.</p></div></div></div>
