    <p>This is the first in a series of posts about Drupal 8's configuration management system. This system is one of its most eagerly anticipated features, <a href="https://drupalize.me/blog/201406/drupal-8-survey-insights">according to a recent survey</a>. The Configuration Management Initiative (CMI) was theÂ <a href="http://buytaert.net/configuration-management-in-drupal-8">first Drupal 8 initiative to be announced in 2011</a>, and we've learned a lot during thousands of hours of work on the initiative since then. These posts will share what we've learned and provide background on the why and how.</p><br />
