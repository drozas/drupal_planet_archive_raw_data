There are over 200 countries in the world, each with its own addressing requirements. Addressfield attempted to provide a sane default for all of them, along with a plugin architecture for handling per-country customizations.  But with so many countries, the list of needed improvements became never-ending, and the customizations themselves started gathering in only one plugin (address.inc), which quickly became impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>A radical change was needed, so after a lot of research we <a href="https://drupalcommerce.org/blog/16864/commerce-2x-stories-addressing">introduced a new plan</a> for Drupal 8, along with a <a href="https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing">brand new PHP library</a> we can depend on from addressfield 8.x-2.x. The new plan resolves around two powerful ideas:</p>
<ul><li>The introduction of address formats, which hold information on how a country’s address and its form need to be rendered and validated.</li>
<li>The use of Google’s addressing dataset, freely available and built for Chrome and Android, with address formats for 200 countries.</li>
</ul><p>The introduced solutions were obviously superior to anything we had before that, but Drupal 8 is still far from production, and we needed improvements on our Drupal 7 sites today, so we decided to try and backport as many concepts as we could into the 7.x-1.x codebase. The result of that is <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2393489">addressfield 7.x-1.0-rc1</a>:</p>
