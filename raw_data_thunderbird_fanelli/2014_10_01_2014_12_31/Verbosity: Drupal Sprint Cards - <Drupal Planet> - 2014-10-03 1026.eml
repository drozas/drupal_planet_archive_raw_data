My team created these cards as a condensed version of the DrupalCon Autsin mentor training. They summraize the top tasks needed for new contributors and coders and can be printed at any local print shop (usually in 12-24h) because we formatted them to be printed on standard business cards. So they are cheap to print and ready when you need them.</p>
<p>These cards have been seen at many Drupal events now and they get a good response wherever they go. The first sprint where they appeared was at the Jersey Shore (thanks again to the NJ team for bringing us there!) and they have since been at camps across North America and now at DrupalCon Amsterdam.</p>
<p>You can find them on our <a href="http://kafei.ca/drupalgive">DrupalGive</a> page, or use<a href="http://kafei.ca/drupal_cards.pdf"> this handy PDF link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Printing Specifications</strong></p>
