<p>        	Why new movies but old music?</p>
<p>        	Maybe new TV is better because old movies – and TV – were not very good simply because moving pictures were a new medium, and it has taken artists time to mature.</p>
<p>        	Maybe old music is better because rock 'n' roll of the ‘60’s and ‘70’s was particularly brilliant, a musical Renaissance era.</p>
<p>        	But we do know that art is subjective; what I like is not necessarily what you like.</p>
<p>        	So though I prefer contemporary movies over the classics, some people opt for the opposite; they think old TV shows were the Renaissance period – and I just have no taste for good television.</p>
<p>        	Is there possibly another explanation, having to do with <em>repetition</em>?</p>
<p>        	Does repetition strengthen and reinforce one’s preference? Or do we just repeat things we like... a lot?</p>
<p>        	I often watch every episode and every season of a TV show I enjoy, but I watch each episode only once. Each episode is similar, but different. The patterns of the characters and interactions are similar, but the dialogue and exact story is, of course, different.</p>
<p>        	But with music, not only do I listen to the same artists, I listen to the same songs over and over again. I’ve heard “Jailhouse Rock” a million times, but only watched the movie once or twice. Hearing something I like, repeatedly, reinforces the song’s pattern, makes me more comfortable with it, and, I think, ultimately leads me to liking it more.</p>
<p>        	The same could be said of software patterns.</p>
<p>        	Building on my last article on “Sculpting Conditionals,” nothing helps me more than reviewing someone else's code. I can quickly detect a pattern I’m not familiar with. Frequently, an unfamiliar design pattern indicates trouble. And if the bad pattern occurs once in a code review, it’s worth checking to see if it was done elsewhere in code that is already committed. Unfamiliar patterns should be a klaxon horn, something deserving attention. After some study I might discover that the new pattern is actually better than the old pattern, and it will become something I adopt, but it is always initially a warning.</p>        </div>
