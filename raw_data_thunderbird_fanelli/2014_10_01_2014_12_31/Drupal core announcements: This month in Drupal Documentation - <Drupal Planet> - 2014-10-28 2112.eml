    <p>This is the monthly update from the <a href="https://drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group">Documentation Working Group (DocWG)</a> on what has been going on in Drupal Documentation. Because this is posted in the Core group, comments for this post are disabled, but if you have comments or suggestions, please see the DocWG home page for how to contact us.</p>
<h3>Drupalcon Documentation Sprint</h3>
<p>A small group of sprinters gathered on the last day of Drupalcon to work on a couple of Documentation issues. During the sprint the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2326111">Installation guide was being reviewed</a> for Drupal 8 and there is still work left to process some of that feedback. Furthermore a start was made <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2326097">writing the Theming guide for Drupal 8</a> (see below for more).</p>
<h3>Theming guide for Drupal 8</h3>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/theme-guide/8">The theming guide for Drupal 8</a> has been written almost from scratch and is beginning to take shape. It already covers such topics as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining a theme with an .info.yml file</li>
<li>Theme folder structure</li>
<li>Working With Twig Templates</li>
<li>Adding stylesheets (CSS) to a Drupal 8 theme</li>
<li>Creating a Drupal 8 sub-theme</li>
<li>Using Classy as a base theme</li>
<li>Adding JavaScript to a Drupal 8 Theme</li>
</ul>
<p>The theming guide still needs a lot of improvement. So if theming is your thing and you have some spare time this month, then please <a href="http://drupal.org/theme-guide/8">review it</a>. Every little improvement is helpful. Note that you can edit documentation pages on drupal.org directly and that there is no need to leave comments.</p>
<h4>Credits</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide">Sander Tirez's theming guide</a>, many <a href="http://drupal.stackexchange.com/search?q=theme+[8]">stackexchange Q&amp;A's</a> and various blog posts proved invaluable input for writing the guide.</p>
<h3>Thanks for contributing!</h3>
<p>Since <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/436958">our last post from October 1</a> about 280 contributors have made some 1100 Drupal.org documentation page revisions, including 10 people that made 15 or more edits. Thank you batigolix, Pierre.Vriens, SERVANT14, Anthony Pero, camorim, sanchiz, tvn, Pere Orga, LoMo, phenaproxima and all the others and keep up the good work!</p>
<h3>Changes to documentation on drupal.org</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2292749">formatting of keywords</a> in the sidebar of documentation pages in drupal.org has been improved.</li>
<li>The display of the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2017673">original author of documentation pages has been removed</a>. This was done because in many cases the wrong original author was being shown.  Now only the most recent revision authors are being shown.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation Working Group meetings are open</h3>
<p>The monthly meeting of the Documentation Working Group is open to anyone who would like to attend. <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/user/6005">Ping us</a> if you want to join the meeting.</p>
<h3>Documentation Priorities</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/priorities">Current documentation priorities page</a> is always a good place to look to figure out what to work on, and has been updated recently.</p>
<p>If you're new to contributing to documentation, these projects may seem a bit overwhelming -- so why not try out a <a href="https://drupal.org/contributor-tasks/writers">New contributor task</a> to get started?</p>
