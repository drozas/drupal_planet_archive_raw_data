<p>We'll be at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre over three days in early March 2015.  March 5-7 to be exact.</p>
<p>Find out more at the website<br /><strong><a href="https://melbourne2015.drupal.org.au/">https://melbourne2015.drupal.org.au/</a></strong></p>
<p>The call for sessions is open, and we're trying hard to get the word out wide and far, to whisper in new ears, and encourage people of all sorts to share their ideas for sessions so we can create a truly wonderful, inspiring, engaging and fun program for this conference!</p>
<p>For those who may not know, <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal is an open source content management system</a>.  It's used by people and organisations all around the world, for all sorts of web sites.  It's also being used as back end application framework for mobile apps!  It's amazing what Drupal can do.</p>
<p>Drupal events are the heart and soul of the community that makes Drupal.  Bringing people together drives the project forward, and forges friendships.  </p>
<p>But we're also part of the wider web.  So we want to hear from all sorts of web specialists, not just Drupalists.</p>
<p>Please, submit a session, or simply help us spread the word.  The deadline is looming and won't be extended. Get that proposal in by 30 November 2014.  <a href="https://melbourne2015.drupal.org.au/program/session-submission">https://melbourne2015.drupal.org.au/program/session-submission</a></p>
