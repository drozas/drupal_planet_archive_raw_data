I managed to clear the exam with the following results:</p>
<ul><li>Section 1 - Fundamental Web Development Concepts: 87%</li>
<li>Section 2 - Site Building: 87%</li>
<li>Section 3 - Front end development (Theming) : 92%</li>
<li>Section 4 - Back end development (Coding) : 81%</li>
</ul><p>Like many others who have done the exam, I will briefly run over my experience and thoughts on the whole process.</p></div></div></div>
