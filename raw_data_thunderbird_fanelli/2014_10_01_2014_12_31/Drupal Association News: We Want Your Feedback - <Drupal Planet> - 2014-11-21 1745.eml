You may have heard that we are working to make the Drupal.org experience better for all of our visitors, but we’re not going to stop there. We also want to make DrupalCon a more valuable and inclusive experience for everyone.</p>
<p>For that, we need help from our friends in the Drupal community. <strong>We’re looking for people who work at companies that use Drupal, but don’t provide a Drupal product or service.</strong> Whether you’re in the C-suite at Twitter, a developer working for a small business, or a manager who oversees the running of a Drupal website, we want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>If you fit this criteria and <u>do not</u> attend DrupalCon</strong>, and would be willing to speak with us, <a href="https://drupalassociation.webform.com/form/14336">please fill out this contact form</a> or leave us a comment. Megan Sanicki, our Associate Director, will be in touch with you shortly to talk to you about how we can improve DrupalCon to better fit the needs of you and your business.</p>
