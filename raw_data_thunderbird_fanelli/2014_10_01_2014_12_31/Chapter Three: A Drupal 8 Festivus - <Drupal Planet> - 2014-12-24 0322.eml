    <p>In the spirit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus">Festivus</a> some members of our team attempted a Drupal 8 feat of strength to ensure we were able to thoroughly air our grievances about the theme layer in Drupal 8.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Several of our front end developers accepted the challenge to build a simple two-page Drupal 8 theme based off of an older project's design.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Below are the areas that most confused them or slowed them down, or tripped them up during the process. I hope you can take advantage of our collected wisdom to smooth out your own first experience with building a theme in 8.</p>
