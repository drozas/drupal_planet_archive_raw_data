We prepared a list of our top ten sessions from the Con for you to catch up with at home (technically nine sessions and one “other cool thing”). In our list, there’s a little something for most everyone, from coders, to themers, to site builders, to those of us who pitch sell Drupal to clients – but we would recommend all of these sessions to anyone involved in Drupal. See how the other side lives!</p>
