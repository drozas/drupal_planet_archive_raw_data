<p><img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/badcamp-sprint-cropped.jpg" />We have a great tradition of extended sprints around big Drupal events. Given that a lot of the Drupal core and contrib developers fly in for these events, it makes a lot of sense to use this opportunity to start sooner and/or extend our stay and work together in one space on the harder problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://2014.badcamp.net/event/core-dev-sprint">BADCamp</a> is next up! BADCamp organizers and sponsors continue to recognize the need for sprints as part of the schedule and are providing space on Wednesday (TBA), great sprint location Thursday through Sunday at the <a href="https://2014.badcamp.net/location">Palace of Fine Arts</a>, and a space on Monday after also (TBA).  There are already various sprints signed up including <em>Multilingual, Drupal 8 Criticals, Panopoly, and Frontend</em>. We are really friendly and need all kinds of expertise!</p>
<p><strong>Now is the time to consider if you can be available and book your travel and hotel accordingly!</strong></p>

<h4>What is a sprint?</h4>
<p>Drupal sprints are opportunities to join existing teams and further Drupal the software, our processes, drupal.org and so on.</p>
<h4>Do I need to be a pro developer?</h4>
<p>No, not at all. First of all sprints include groups working on user experience, designs, frontend guidelines, drupal.org software setup, testing improvements, figuring out policies, etc. However you can be more productive at most sprints if you have a laptop.</p>
<h4>Why are there 6 consecutive days of sprints?</h4>
<p>This is a time when many people in the Drupal community get together. We try to use this time to share our knowledge as well as further the platform in all possible ways. Therefore there is almost always an opportunity and a place to participate in moving Drupal forward.</p>
<h4>What if I'm new to Drupal and/or sprinting, how can I join?</h4>
<p>If you feel new and would love helping hands, please attend. It can take a day or a couple days to get set up and find something to work on. But, the great thing is, we have plenty of days to do that, find a group to work with, and get things really moved forward together.</p>
