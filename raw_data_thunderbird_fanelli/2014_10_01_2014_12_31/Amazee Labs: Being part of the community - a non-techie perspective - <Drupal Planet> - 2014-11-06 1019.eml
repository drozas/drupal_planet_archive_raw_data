          <div class="field-item"><p>Recently our Sitebuilder <a href="http://www.amazeelabs.com/en/boris-baldinger" target="_blank">Boris</a> shared <a href="http://www.amazeelabs.com/en/blog/be-part-of-the-community" target="_blank">his thoughts</a> on the Drupal community. So I thought I’d share my thoughts on it too, but from a perspective of a non-techie!</p>

          <div class="field-item"><p>It’s been one and a half years since I joined the Amazee Crew. Within the first 6 months only one day a week complementary to my studies in Business Administration. Yep, you’ve read that correctly, I don’t have any background in tech, not to mention open source CMS. HTML, CSS and PHP were only a couple of letters to me and people sitting behind the screen coding seemed somewhat geeky to me. I would have only been involved with Drupal if some of the fashion and beauty blogs that I read would run on Drupal.</p>
<p><img data-editor-file-uuid="66a0deeb-fe75-4810-ba00-dac417ae860c" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/15400768345_fab68b8d39_o%20%281%29.jpg" /><br />
Fascinated by the colored lines of code on the screens of our developers (who I hold dear and absolutely enjoy working with) I very much looked forward to my first DrupalCon in Prague in 2013.</p>
<p>
Truth be told, I was quite overwhelmed by the immensity of the community. And honestly, walking into a sprint room did make me feel a bit like being in the wrong place, but I decided to join the fun and give it at try (no I did not sprint, that wouldn’t be helpful to anybody).</p>
<p><img alt="" data-editor-file-uuid="0785da23-7cf4-4e79-9f44-680d0a3a0593" height="800" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/15479596948_e90b86dd60_o.jpg" width="1200" /></p>
<p>I attended various sessions, in some of them I could actually understand something, some of them were just way to tech for me. During the week I’ve met a lot of really nice people and I had to admit that I did the community wrong in the first place. It wasn’t all geeky and tech talk; you’d be surprised what kind of hidden talents you can find there! Singers, musicians, paragliders, you name it.</p>
<p>A year later my HTML, CSS and PHP skills are still bad, but I did learn a bit and can do some basic stuff by myself. I enjoyed DrupalCon Amsterdam even more and found myself hanging out with and getting to know more people of the community from all over the world.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-editor-file-uuid="5435651a-9e02-4598-bd02-2dc0f2e3c22e" height="3840" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/9963701936_44c39bec8b_o.jpg" width="5760" /></p>
<p>You’ll probably never find my coding the next big module (but then never say never) but you’ll definitely find me at a Drupal event. Because what I have experienced along the way is quite similar to what Boris experienced; Drupal is way more than just an open source CMS. And the community behind it is way more than just a bunch of geeks; it’s a community whit highly versatile skilled people who certainly know how to have fun and will give you a warm welcome, no matter what your background is. I never would have thought that a non-tech girl like me would end up in an open source CMS community and actually finding her way to contribute, even if it’s not writing code. That in fact is another aspect I like about the community - the chance to be able to contribute even if you’re not able to write patches.</p>
<p>
As for me, I’m looking forward to the next <a href="http://barcelona2015.drupal.org/" target="_blank">DrupalCon in Barcelona </a>and might actually even try and check out the local <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/switzerland" target="_blank">Drupal User Group. </a></p>
