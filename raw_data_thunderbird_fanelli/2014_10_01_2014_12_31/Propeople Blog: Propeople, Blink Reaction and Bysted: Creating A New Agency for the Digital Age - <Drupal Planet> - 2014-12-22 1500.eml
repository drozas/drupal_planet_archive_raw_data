    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Earlier today, Propeople (together with our parent company, Intellecta) made <a href="/news/propeople-blink-reaction-and-bysted-together-form-the-largest-drupal-agency-in-the-world">two big announcements</a> that I am really excited about. The first is that Blink Reaction is joining our larger Intellecta family, and will be merging with Propeople - creating the largest professional Drupal services company in the world! The second piece of news is that Propeople is also merging with Bysted, one of Denmark’s foremost creative agencies. Together, these two deals are strategic in starting an exciting new chapter for Propeople.</p><p>Intellecta’s purchase of an 80 percent stake in Blink Reaction also means that Blink Reaction will be operating under my direct management. Our companies will initially operate as independent units but will join together as a new company under a unified brand by the deal’s completion on March 31st, 2015. This new agency will have a truly unique international reach - with 350+ employees worldwide, working across 9 countries. The new agency’s global footprint and working capacity will be unmatched in the Drupal space.</p><p>It is an honor to lead the start of a whole new chapter for Propeople and Blink Reaction. I hold the company that Nancy Stango (Founder and CEO of Blink Reaction) and her team have built in very high esteem, and can’t wait to see what we’ll be able to achieve together.</p><p>Welcoming Blink Reaction into the Intellecta family will greatly expand our technical capacity, specially when it comes to the development of digital solutions built on Drupal. At the same time, bringing Bysted into Propeople will bring our creative, design, and strategy offerings to new levels. Both of these developments will prove to be strategic in charting the future direction in which Propeople is heading.</p><p>This future direction is driven by the vision of being a full-service agency for the digital age. Propeople is an agency that has had a truly technical upbringing; this is at the core of our identity, manifests itself through our entire organization’s culture and touches everything that we do.</p><p>The majority of the prominent agencies in the larger digital space tend to come from strong creative or communication backgrounds. The fact that Propeople comes from a technology background is a significant distinction in a world where technical matters have become increasingly more important for organizations as they develop their brand’s digital presence. And I’m not just talking about the importance of coding - but the larger way that analytics, data, and integrations with a variety of systems seem to be the common threads running through everything that a company does.</p><p>Today marks an important milestone for me, the Propeople team around the world and our customers. I, for one, can’t wait to get started!</p></div></div></div><div id="comment-wrapper-nid-1666"></div><div class="field field-name-field-drupal-planet field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Check this option to include this post in Planet Drupal aggregator:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/drupal/planet" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">planet</a></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-topics field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Topics:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><a href="/topics/business-strategy" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Business &amp; Strategy</a></div></div></div>
