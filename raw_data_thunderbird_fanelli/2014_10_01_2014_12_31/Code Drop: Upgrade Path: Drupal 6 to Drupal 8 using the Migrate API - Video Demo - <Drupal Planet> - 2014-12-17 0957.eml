I've been working towards a successful end to end migration from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 and after debugging 5 core bugs, I finally have a working solution. Checkout the video!</p>

<p>The video shows an out the box Drupal 6 website with a bunch of fields, taxonomies and settings created. Most of the stuff comes across to Drupal 8 but there are still a few issues that need work.</p>
<h2>Current Core Bugs</h2>
<p>These are the core bugs that are required to get this demo working.</p></div></div></div>
