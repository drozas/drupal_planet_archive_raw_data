<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Drupal is a great CMS but really isn't very powerful out of the box. To harness its power you'll need to use contrib (contributed) modules. Contributed modules are created by the community and are not part of the core Drupal download. But they can be downloaded and installed from the drupal.org website.</p>
