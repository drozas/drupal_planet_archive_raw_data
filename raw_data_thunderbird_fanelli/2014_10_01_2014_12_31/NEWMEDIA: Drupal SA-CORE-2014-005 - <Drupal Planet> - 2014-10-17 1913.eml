Over the course of the past year we have been refining our continuous integration and hosting platforms as they relate to Drupal. A significant threat, and subsequent fix has been identifeid in all versions of Drupal 7 that has literally rocked the. The good news is that your site is already patched if you are hosting a Drupal 7 site with us. The great news is that we have an opportunity to highlight some of the improvements we have made to our hosting offering.</p>

<p>The new system provides a smoother flow between development efforts and your ability to see the changes. When a developer's code is accepted to your project, it is immediately made visible to you in a password protected staging environment. When the change is approved, it can immediately be made available on the production site. Our systems ensure that the servers developed on are identical to the servers in the staging and production environments. This consistency increases the return on your investment by decreasing the amount of time it takes for a developer to perform their tasks. At the same time, it gaurantees a smoother deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>We are systematically moving all of our hosting properties into this new system.</p>

<p>* Your sites will now be hosted in what is known as Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud. This is the next generation of Amazon's cloud offering that provides advanced network control and separation for increased performance and security.</p>

<p>* Your sites will move from a static ip address to utilize state of the art load balancing techniques. The load balancing and proxy layers provide significant protection agains DDoS and other types of attacks that might be utilized against a website.</p>

<p>* Your DNS management will simplify. The same technology we are using at the load balancing layer allows for a more dynamic system. Because we are moving from addressing the machines by numbers to addressing them by name we are allowed additional flexibility. For example, let's say your site is under a higher than average load. We could temporarily add additional webservers that would increase the performance of your site.</p>

<p>* Site performance will improve. You are being moved to a distributed system that is more capable of handling your sites needs.</p>

<p>The goal of this is to increase the quality of our services and offerings while continuing the tradition of giving back. It is unfortunate that a security issue of this magnitude has affected Drupal. It is good to see the community come together to help bring the current set of continuous integration and deployment practices to the next level.Â  Come find us at the http://2013.badcamp.net/events/drupal-devops-summit to see how we do continuous.</p>

<p>Help us figure out the best way to share!</p></div></div></div>
