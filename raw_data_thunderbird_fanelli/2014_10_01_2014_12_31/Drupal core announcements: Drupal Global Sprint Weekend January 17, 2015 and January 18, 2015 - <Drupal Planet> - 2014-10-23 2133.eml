<p>Resources for participating in a sprint (needs updating for 2015, but this is a start):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/list-changes/drupal">Drupal 8 change notifications</a></li>
<li>Resources for contributed module developers: <a href="https://drupal.org/drupal-8">upgrading your modules to Drupal 8</a>. Look at git logs and 8.x issues from <a href="https://drupal.org/project/project_module?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc&amp;f[3]=drupal_core%3A7234&amp;f[4]=sm_field_project_type%3Afull">modules that have already started a 8.x branch</a>. As you port, first commit a 7.x version as initial 8.x, and make frequent public commits (and issues in your issue queue!). In those commit messages: 1) say what you did, *and* 2) add "per ...." and site the change record, or link to an example in another module that led you to think that was what needed to be done. The "per" is really useful. See also the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/pants">Pants</a> example module. </li>
<li>(from 2013 need a 2015 version) <a href="http://www.comm-press.de/en/blog/preparations-global-sprint-weekend-march-9-and-10">Preparations for Sprint Weekend</a> includes what to bring, and how to find/groom issues.</li>
<li>Use irc, and post a comment when about to work on an issue.</li>

<li></li>
</ul>
<p>A blurb to add to your session/event description (edit to fit your event):</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone is welcome; if you have built a site in Drupal, you can contribute. We will split into groups and work on Drupal core issues. Bring your laptop. For new folks: you can get a head start also by making an account on Drupal.org, getting some <a href="https://www.drupal.org/dev-env">contribution tools</a>, and developers can install git before coming and git clone Drupal 8 core. </p></blockquote>
<p>The curious might want to see the locations from <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/332998">2014</a> and <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/277768">2013</a>.</p>
