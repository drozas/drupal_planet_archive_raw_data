The new release is relatively stable and many of its helper modules have already supported it (see the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2377503" rel="nofollow">full list here</a>).</p>
<p>According to my survey last year, most sites that were using or planned to use Recommender API were small- to medium-sized. Their priorities were: 1) ease-of-use, 2) security, and 3) good recommendations. The new release is the answer to the calls. A few features to emphasize here:</p>
<ol><li>RecAPI <strong>runs out-of-the-box</strong> if you use its PHP recommendation engine for small site. As your site grows, you can choose to use the more powerful and more complex Java recommendation engine.</li>
<li>RecAPI fully integrates with <strong>Views and EntityAPI</strong> so you can customize easily.</li>
<li>RecAPI now has <strong>better documentation</strong> and an example module to teach you how to write helper modules for your particular needs.</li>
</ol><p>For the rest of this article, I'll show you how to set up and use the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/history_rec" rel="nofollow">Browsing History Recommender module</a>, which uses RecAPI to provides two types of content recommendations based on users' browsing history: "users who viewed this also viewed..." and "personalized recommendations". </p>
