    <p>Alongside the long awaited <strong>Drupal 8 Beta</strong> release, we have also updated our first Drupal 8 theme. We haven't include many new features but we have tried to clean up its code and have improved our starter kit. Anyway, let's dig into the latest new features we have discovered with the first Beta releases of Drupal 8. Feel free to check out the code on <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/prius" target="_blank">drupal.org</a> or read our dedicated <a href="http://mariquecalcus.com/blogs/our-first-drupal-8-theme" target="_blank">blog entry</a> if you want to find out more about our <strong>first Drupal 8 theme</strong>. If you can wait to see the result, take a look at our <a href="http://prius.mariquecalcus.com/" target="_blank">online demo</a>.</p>
