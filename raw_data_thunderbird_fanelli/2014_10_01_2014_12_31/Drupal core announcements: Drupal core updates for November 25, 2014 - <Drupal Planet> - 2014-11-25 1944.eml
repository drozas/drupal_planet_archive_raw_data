    <h2>What's new with Drupal 8?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2373889">Drupal 8.0.0 beta3 was released</a> since the last core update, with over 200 fixes after the prior release. There are still over 100 known critical issues, which means more beta releases to come.</p>
<p>We take special care to resolve security and performance issues. Both types of issues may require API changes. There is now <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1744302#critical-perf-issues">defined criteria for performance issues</a> as to what kind of improvements qualify as critical issues (and therefore blocking the Drupal 8.0.0 release).</p>
<p>After 2.5 years of work in part sponsored by MongoDB Inc, led by Károly Négyesi (chx), Drupal 8 can now completely install with MongoDB. This is the first time Drupal in its entirety has been successfully installed in a NoSQL database.<br />

<p>In almost three weeks, the Drupal Association and Wunderkraut are sponsoring a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/447123">focused sprint in Ghent</a> to help move core critical issues forward. However, you can help make things move faster anytime from anywhere, so read on!</p>
<h2>Where's Drupal 8 at in terms of release?</h2>
<p>Since November 8,  we've fixed 29 critical issues and 26 major issues, and opened 19 criticals and 40 majors. That puts us overall at <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">117 release-blocking critical issues</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=15&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=300&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">717 major issues</a>.</p>
<h3>How long does it take to fix a critical?</h3>
<p>So how long will it take us to fix those critical issues and get to a Drupal 8 release candidate? The average time it takes to fix a critical issue varies enormously depending on the scope of the problem and the resources our contributors can devote to fixing each. Over the course of the Drupal 8 development cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% of critical issues were fixed within one week of being filed,</li>
<li>50% of criticals were fixed within one month of being filed,</li>
<li>80% of criticals were fixed within six months,</li>
<li>and then 20% took more than six months.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that one great way to help get Drupal 8 to a release faster is to accelerate some of those long-running issues. Look for the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status[0]=1&amp;status[1]=13&amp;status[2]=8&amp;status[3]=14&amp;status[4]=15&amp;status[5]=4&amp;priorities[0]=400&amp;categories[0]=1&amp;categories[1]=2&amp;version[0]=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;text=&amp;assigned=&amp;submitted=&amp;issue_tags=&amp;&amp;order=created&amp;sort=asc">oldest critical issues</a>, or the critical issues that have <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status[0]=1&amp;status[1]=13&amp;status[2]=8&amp;status[3]=14&amp;status[4]=15&amp;status[5]=4&amp;priorities[0]=400&amp;categories[0]=1&amp;categories[1]=2&amp;version[0]=8.x&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;text=&amp;assigned=&amp;submitted=&amp;issue_tags=&amp;&amp;order=last_comment_timestamp&amp;sort=asc">gone awhile with no updates</a>, and help assess them. Is each still relevant? Is something blocking it? What's the next step that's needed? Is the issue summary up to date? As we both focus on our next milestone and bring these longer-running issues to a successful resolution, we'll be able to narrow our focus to incoming issues and get Drupal 8 done. :)</p>
<h2>Current focus</h2>
<p>The current top priority in Drupal 8 is to resolve issues that block a beta-to-beta upgrade path (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;version%5B%5D=8.0.x-dev&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=D8+upgrade+path">critical issues tagged 'D8 upgrade path'</a>). Supporting an upgrade path between betas is an important step for early adopters to begin building with Drupal 8 (and lending their resources to getting other critical issues done).</p>
<p>We also need core contributors to continue <a href="https://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks/update-allowed-beta">evaluating issues for the beta phase</a> based on the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/beta-changes">beta changes policy</a>. Note that <a href="https://dreditor.org/">Dreditor</a> now includes a handy button for inserting a beta evaluation template in issue summaries! Thanks Cottser and Mark Carver for adding this feature so quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://groups.drupal.org/files/beta_evaluation_button.png" alt="The new Dreditor button to &#039;Insert beta evaluation&#039;" /></p>
<p>Finally, keep an eye out for critical issues that are blocking other work. Add the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status%5B%5D=1&amp;status%5B%5D=13&amp;status%5B%5D=8&amp;status%5B%5D=14&amp;status%5B%5D=4&amp;priorities%5B%5D=400&amp;categories%5B%5D=1&amp;categories%5B%5D=2&amp;version%5B%5D=8.0.x-dev&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D&amp;issue_tags=blocker">blocker</a> issue tag that other issues are postponed.</p>
<p>(Note that we're changing this section of the Drupal Core Updates to highlight ongoing goals rather than specific issues, because calls to action in these posts haven't resulted in additional momentum in highlighted issues. Instead, we'll be making brief, separate posts every week or two highlighting top-priority issues in critical areas. If you're a core subsystem maintainer or initiative lead and want to highlight a specific issue, we encourage you to <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/add/story?gids[]=167169">submit your own brief announcement to g.d.o/core (requires access)</a>. Anyone in <a href="http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/tree/core/MAINTAINERS.txt">MAINTAINERS.txt</a> is authorized to post to this group!)</p>
