    <p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/cilefen">cilefen</a> begin to work on the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2278017">When a content entity type providing module is uninstalled, the entities are not fully deleted, leaving broken references</a> issue. Turned out that a necessary dependent issue is already being worked on so he was able proceed well. I am reasonably confident this issue will get resolved in due time. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/sam-hermans">Sam Hermans</a> have advanced <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2172017">Bulk operations does not respect entity access</a> forward which is great but it still needs some work. Let's note that Sam "only" had a core patch reroll so far and yet he was able to move a critical forward! You could do it as well: I will be waiting for you on IRC in channel #drupal-contribute every Friday noon Pacific (9pm CET).</p>
