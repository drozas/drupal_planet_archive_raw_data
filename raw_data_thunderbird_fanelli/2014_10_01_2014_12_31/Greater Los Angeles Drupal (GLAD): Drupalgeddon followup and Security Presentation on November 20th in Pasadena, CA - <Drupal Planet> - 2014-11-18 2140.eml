You may not have heard, though, that here in Los Angeles, California, we're dedicating a portion of several upcoming meetups to web security and helping provide our group members with any resources they need.</p>
<p>If you can make it, please join us this week for a special presentation, <strong>Better Sleep Through Web Security</strong>. It's this Thursday, November 20th, at 6pm in Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Drupalgeddon or don't know if your Drupal sites have been updated since the announcement, please stop reading and see the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalsa05FAQ">SA-CORE-2014-005 FAQ</a> immediately. You need to take action and contact a service provider about protecting your Drupal site and hosting environment. </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Better Sleep Through Web Security</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.drupal.la/sites/default/files/glad-logo-75x84_2.png" width="75" height="84" alt="Greater Los Angeles Drupal" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" /><a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/104">Christefano Reyes</a> presents <strong>Better Sleep Through Web Security</strong>, an in-depth overview of web security, what to do do if your website is hacked, and how to sleep better by following basic web security best practices. </p>
<p>The "Drupalgeddon" vulnerability has been covered in mainstream news including <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/10/30/did-drupal-drop-the-ball-users-who-didnt-update-within-7-hours-should-assume-theyve-been-hacked/">Forbes</a>, the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29846539">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/30/drupal_sites_considered_hosed_if_sqli_hole_unclosed/">The Register</a>, and has brought web security, frequently an overlooked part of web development, back to the center stage. </p>
<p>This particular vulnerability, officially known as <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2357241">SA-CORE-2014-005</a>, allows attackers with specialized knowledge to send requests to any unprotected Drupal website that result in arbitrary SQL execution, which in turn may lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary PHP execution and total server control. </p>
<p>Topics that will be covered in this presentation include:</p>
<ul><li>Security vs. Privacy
</li><li>Common Attack Vectors
</li><li>Drupal's security record and the Drupal Security Team
</li><li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2357241">SA-CORE-2014-005</a> (also known as "Drupalgeddon")
</li><li>I've Been Hacked! Now What?
</li><li>Best Practices for Helping Others and Yourself
</li><li>Resources
</li><li>Questions / Answers
</li></ul><p>Christefano is one of the founders of <a href="http://www.larks.la">Exaltation of Larks</a>, a Drupal design and engineering firm with a worldwide team of Drupal experts; and <a href="http://www.droplabs.net">Droplabs</a>, an open source-friendly coworking space and business incubator near Downtown Los Angeles.
