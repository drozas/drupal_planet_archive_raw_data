<p>DrupalCon Amsterdam has wrapped up, and now that we're over the jet lag, it's time to look back on one of the most successful DrupalCons to date. DrupalCon Amsterdam was the largest European DrupalCon yet, by far. Just to knock your socks off, here are some numbers:</p>
<ul><li>
		More than 2,300 attendees showed up to 120 sessions and nearly 100 BoFs</li>
<li>
		115 attendees showed up to the community summit and the business summit</li>
<li>
		146 training attendees, 400 trivia night attendees, and 400 Friday sprinters made the week a success</li>
<li>
		…and through it all, we ate 1,200 stroopwafels.</li>
</ul><p>The fun extended to more than just the conference -- with 211 transit passes and 56 bike rentals, attendees from over 64 countries were able to enjoy all the city of Amsterdam had to offer. What a success!<br />
As with any DrupalCon, DrupalCon Amsterdam wouldn't have been a success without lots and lots of help from our passionate volunteers. We'd like to take a moment to send out a big THANK YOU to all of our track chairs and summit organizers:</p>

</ul><p>We also appreciate everything our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core-mentoring">core mentors</a> did to make DrupalCon Amsterdam a hit — and it’s thanks to lots of hard work from our passionate community members that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0.0-beta1">Drupal 8 is in Beta</a>!<br />
We hope you had as fun and exiting a time in Amsterdam as we did. For those of us who weren’t able to make it, and even for those who were, you can relive the fun on the flickr stream, or catch any number of great sessions on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpeDXSh4nHjQBf_SOdQgY-k6TnbCn3pSj">Drupal Association YouTube channel</a>.  And remember to mark your calendar for <a href="https://barcelona2015.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Barcelona</a> in September 2015. See you there! Below is Holly Ross' set of slides from the Amsterdam closing session.</p>
