<p>The fifth class of our Drupal career training program is just about at the halfway mark, and our students are eager to put their new skills to work. The six <a href="http://drupaleasy.com/academy/dco/course-information">Drupal Career Online</a> students will be ready for junior-developer-level work in mid-November, and we're looking for forward-thinking organizations willing to help our graduates on the next leg of their Drupal career journey.</p>
<p>As we've done for the past five classes, (we've had more than 60 graduates so far) we're looking to make introductions between our upcoming graduates and organizations looking for people with Drupal site-building and development skills. Our <a href="http://drupaleasy.com/academy/we-drupal-hosts">Work Experience Drupal (WE Drupal)</a> program is designed to provide students with valuble experience in internship-type settings. WE Drupal host companies are asked to make a 6-10 week commitment to one or more of our students, provide them with guidance, mentoring, and the professional experience that is so difficult to come by for new Drupal site builders and developers. In return, you get the efforts of a well-prepared, super-eager Drupal novice to help you lighten the task-load for your staff.</p>
