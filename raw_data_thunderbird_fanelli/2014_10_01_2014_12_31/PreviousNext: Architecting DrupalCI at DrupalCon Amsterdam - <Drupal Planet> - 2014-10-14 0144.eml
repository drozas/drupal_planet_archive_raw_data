    <p>At the recent DrupalCon Amsterdam sprints something amazing happened, people from all corners of the globe assembled to sprint on DrupalCI. DrupalCI is an initiative born out of the requirement for new testbot infrastructure. Our goal is to implement a brand new <span>Continuous Integration (CI)</span> workflow that can not only be used for Drupal but anyone wishing to run a CIÂ infrastructure / Automated tasks. Until this point we had only corresponded via a weekly hangout and IRC.</p>
<p>While this was keeping us on track with building out some of the components, the conference gave us an opportunity to sit down in the same room and perform an end-to-end architectural review to ensure we didn't have any gaps.  A modular design approach has been used to ensure that many of the following components could be used as a standalone entity in any infrastructure.</p>
