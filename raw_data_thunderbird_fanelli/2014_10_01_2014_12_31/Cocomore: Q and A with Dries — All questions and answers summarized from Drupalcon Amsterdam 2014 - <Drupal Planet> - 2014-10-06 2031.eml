    <noglossary><p>One Drupalcon session of particular interest to many in the community, since the first of them, has been the “Q&amp;A with Dries”, a core-conversation -track, where <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/dries" title="Dries Buytaert | Drupal.org">Dries</a> is joined by a panel of his initiative leads and other major contributors to Drupal 8 core development. Since I'd wished, in the past, that sessions like these had a video recording to show who was talking, I brought my DSLR and a shotgun microphone this time, thinking I'd contribute the resulting video. I don't think the video I shot was technically perfect enough to share and I realized that one panel member also prefers to limit her exposure on the Web and respect that, of course; since it's much easier to blur or block out a face in a few images than in a video, and since you can read this summary in much less time than the hour+ -length session, too, I decided to provide stills from the video, along with a summary of the questions and answers, which ranged from the whimsical (a bet on how long it would be till Drupal 8 would be released as “stable” to various business and architecture questions and concerns.</p>
