    <p>I was not posting to the blog for a long time, and finally itâ€™s time to share my experience with new project. This post will also cover some badly structured thoughts about PHP frameworks&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>As part of Qwintry team, we&#8217;ve built a great b2b product in logistics sphere - <a href="http://logistics.qwintry.com/">Qwintry Logistics - delivery from US to Russia</a> - and it was built on a new PHP framework, so it was a big deal for us - lots of new experience, and it&#8217;s great that it was not just experience but a business success as well :)<br />
