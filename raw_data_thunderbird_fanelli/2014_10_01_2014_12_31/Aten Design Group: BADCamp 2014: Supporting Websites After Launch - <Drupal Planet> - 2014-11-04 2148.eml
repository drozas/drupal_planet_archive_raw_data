If you tried to get your oil changed at an assembly line instead of an auto body shop, the factory would turn you down, or worse do a slipshod job to get you out of the way and get back to building cars.</p>

<p>Similarly, most web development shops create their process around building websites, not supporting them. Aten built a dedicated Support Team out of recognition that maintaining and extending websites requires its own skill set and organizational structure.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://2014.badcamp.net/">BADCamp 2014</a>, <a href="http://atendesigngroup.com/about/sandra-chung">Sandra</a> and I, both Technical Account Managers and developers on Aten’s Support Team, will present “<a href="https://2014.badcamp.net/session/old-dogs-new-tricks-supporting-websites-after-launch" target="_blank">Old dogs, new tricks: Supporting websites after launch</a>”, Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 1:30pm. </p>

<p>We’ll discuss why it’s important for clients to work with a development team specifically designed to support existing sites, and how Aten’s support approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeps aging sites relevant with new features;</li>
<li>keeps sites running longer with less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" target="_blank">technical debt</a>;</li>
<li>gives us enormous insight throughout a project’s lifecycle so we can consult on a client’s high level objectives and real world challenges;</li>
<li>and makes us a flexible partner who can puts clients’ minds at ease, with both a rapid response team for hot fixes, and a technical and strategic resource at the ready for larger blocks of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also discuss how viewing support and maintenance as an opportunity — not an opportunity cost — benefits Aten as well as our clients, and why we think our approach incentivizes great work from developers while building enduring client relationships.</p>

<p>See you at BADCamp!</p>
