Today was day 3 of Drupalcon Amsterdam, and it started with a bang with Cory Doctorow as the keynote speaker. Cory is a noted Open Source activist, journalist, and blogger, and he has a long history of involvement with the Drupal community. He spoke passionately about the importance of transparency in software in an age when computers pervade every aspect of our lives. “we should be concerned about making free software because people want to be free, and people cannot be free in an information age without freedom of access to information,” he declared. The speech was inspiring for the crowd here, and I recommend that you give it a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaf3Sl2r3jE">watch</a>.</p>

The buzz around the keynote was quickly replaced by much bigger news: Drupal 8 Beta has finally been released! The official announcement is available on drupal.org: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0.0-beta1">https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0.0-beta1</a>. We are proud and honored that so many Forum One developers have been among the 2,300 people who have contributed to Drupal 8.</p>

Campbell and I devoted a large chunk of today prepping for our session, Coder vs. Themer, and the associated BOF (Birds of a Feather) workshop. In the session we explore the division in most development teams between the two kinds of developers. We take the style of a kung fu battle as we race each other to “live code” a working site in front of the audience. In the workshop we divide participants into teams to take the same challenge, and try different collaboration styles throughout the session. For those who have not seen our promo video, here it is again: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRhLHBxYg-0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRhLHBxYg-0</a></p>

We capped off the evening by taking part in the musical portion of Cultural Night. Jam (HornCologne) led off with a trio of pieces for Alphorn. Yes, Alphorn. Like in the Ricola commercials! Then Campbell and I sang a rendition of the famous duet from Mozart’s Don Giovanni, La ci darem la mano. However, we did replace the Italian words with Drupal lyrics, “Panels handles layouts&#8230;”. We were accompanied by organizer Peter Grond’s excellent string quartet, who played beautifully but also with a great sense of fun. For example, they followed our operatic duet with the theme from the Mario Bros video game! They also played a few fusion jazz/classical pieces that I later found out were composed by members of the quartet. The evening was so inspirational that we plan to make Drupal Musical Night a regular part of the Drupalcon experience!</p>
<p>And now to sleep, Campbell and I present <a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/coder-vs-themer-ultimate-grudge-smackdown-fight-death">Coder vs. Themer</a> at 10:45am tomorrow morning in the main auditorium!</p>
