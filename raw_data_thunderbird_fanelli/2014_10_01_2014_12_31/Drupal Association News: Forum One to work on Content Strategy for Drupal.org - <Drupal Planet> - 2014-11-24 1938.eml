We got a number of great submissions, and the next couple of weeks the Drupal Association staff and the Drupal.org Content Working Group members spent reviewing proposals and interviewing potential vendors.</p>
<p>Today we are happy to announce that we’ve selected a vendor for the content strategy project: <a href="http://forumone.com/">Forum One</a>, an open-source digital agency.</p>
<p>Their proposal met all our project requirements and outlined a solid plan for how we can make this project happen. During the interviews Forum One impressed us with their professionalism, passion for content strategy, their extensive experience working on large content strategy projects, and their deep knowledge of the Drupal community and Drupal.org, the website.</p>
<p>We believe that together our staff and Forum One team will make this project a success. Can’t wait to start working and improve Drupal.org content for all our varied audiences.</p>
