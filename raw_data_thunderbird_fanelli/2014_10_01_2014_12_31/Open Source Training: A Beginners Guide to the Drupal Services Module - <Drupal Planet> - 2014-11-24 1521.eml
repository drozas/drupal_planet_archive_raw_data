<p>The Services module allows to provide web services from your Drupal site.</p>
<p>Services is really popular and works with formats such as REST, XMLRPC, JSON and SOAP.</p>
<p>However, when asked about Services during a training in class last week, I was realized that the students were asking me because there was little-to-no clear documentation available.</p>
