<p>The &#8220;Drupalgeddon&#8221; vulnerability has been covered in mainstream news including <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/10/30/did-drupal-drop-the-ball-users-who-didnt-update-within-7-hours-should-assume-theyve-been-hacked/">Forbes</a>, the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29846539"><span class="caps">BBC</span></a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/30/drupal_sites_considered_hosed_if_sqli_hole_unclosed/">The Register</a>, and has brought web security, frequently an overlooked part of web development, back to the center&nbsp;stage. </p>
