In 2014, we picked up an additional member institution that has been using ELMSLN for online courses. Wisconsin Law Schoolâ€™s Center for Patient Partnerships has been avid supporters of ELMSLN even prior to adoption in the past year and are very happy with the flexibility and control that it gives them over learning environment development.</p>
