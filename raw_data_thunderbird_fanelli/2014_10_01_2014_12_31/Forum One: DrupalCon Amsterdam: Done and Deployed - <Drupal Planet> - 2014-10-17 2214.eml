Drupal 8 Beta released, core contributions made, and successful sessions presented!</p>
<p>Drupal 8 Beta — has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?! But what exactly does that mean? According to the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0.0-beta1">drupal.org release announcement</a>, “Betas are good testing targets for developers and site builders who are comfortable reporting (and where possible, fixing) their own bugs, and who are prepared to rebuild their test sites from scratch if necessary. Beta releases are <i>not</i> recommended for non-technical users, nor for production websites.” Or more simply put, we’re over the hump, but we’re not there yet. But you can help!</p>
<h2>Contrib to Core</h2>
<p>One of the biggest focal points of this DrupalCon was contributing to Drupal 8 core in the largest code sprints of the year. Specially trained mentors helped new contributors set up their development environments, find tasks, and work on issues. This model is actually repeated at Drupal events all over the world, all year long. So even if you missed the Con, code sprints are <a href="http://www.drupical.com/">happening all the time</a> and the community truly welcomes all coders, novice or expert.</p>

She is very passionate about helping new people contribute.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was my third time mentoring at DrupalCon and like every time, it not only gave me an opportunity to share my knowledge, but also learn from others. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/tstoeckler">Tobias Stockler</a> took time to explain to me the Drupal 8 plugin system and walk me through an example. And <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/fgm">fgm</a> explained Traits to me and worked on a related issue.</p>

<h2>Forum One Steps Up</h2>
<p>While the sprints raged on, other Forum One team members led training sessions for people currently developing with Drupal. I, Campbell, presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc1ujlWlA0c">Panels, Display Suite, and Context &#8211; oh my!</a> to a capacity crowd (200+), and together, we presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxFcAyyiScU">Coder vs. Themer: Ultimate Grudge Smackdown Fight to the Death</a> to over three hundred coders and themers. Now that Drupal 8 Beta is released we’re already looking forward to creating a Drupal 8 version of Coder vs. Themer for both <a href="https://losangeles2015.drupal.org/">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="http://barcelona2015.drupal.org/">Barcelona</a>!<br />

<p>This year’s European DrupalCon was a huge success, and a lot of fun! As a group, our Forum One team got to take a leading role in teaching, mentoring, and sharing with the rest of the Drupal community. It’s easy to pay lip service to open source values, but we really love the opportunity to show how important this community is to us. We recently estimated that we contribute almost a hundred patches to Drupal contrib projects in a good month. We’re pretty proud of that participation, but it’s only at the conventions that we get to engage with other Drupalists face to face. DrupalCon isn’t just for the code, or the sessions. It’s for seeing and having fun with our friends and colleagues, too.</p>
<p>At Amsterdam, we got to participate in code sprints, lead sessions and BOFs (birds of a feather sessions), and join the community in lots of fun extracurricular activities. We’re already making plans for DrupalCon LA in the spring. We’ll see you there!</p>
