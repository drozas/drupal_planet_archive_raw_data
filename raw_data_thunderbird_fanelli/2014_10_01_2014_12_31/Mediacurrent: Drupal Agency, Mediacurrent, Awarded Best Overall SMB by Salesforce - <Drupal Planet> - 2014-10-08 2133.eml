The award celebrates the best overall marketing and sales story at the SMB level (1-100 employees). Over <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/">100,000 companies use Salesforce</a>, and hundreds of nominations were submitted for the<a href="http://www.salesforce.com/campaigns/surfboard-awards/"> Salesforce Surfboard awards</a>, so saying “we’re honored” to, not only be nominated, but win this award would be an understatement.</p>
