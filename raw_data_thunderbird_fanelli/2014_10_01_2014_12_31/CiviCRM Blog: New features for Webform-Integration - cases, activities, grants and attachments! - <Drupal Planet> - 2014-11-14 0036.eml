        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Thanks to sponsorship from Amnesty Intl. Spain and GMCVO the Webform-Integration module now has 4 new features available for you to try out:</p>
<ul><li>
		<strong>Support for CiviGrant</strong> - allows front-end users to apply for grants and update their application information.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Multiple Cases</strong> - open or update any number of cases on a single webform.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Multiple Activities</strong> - Create as many activities as you wish. <br />
		Activity and case settings have been decoupled from each other so you can file activities on a case, or not, independent of what cases you are working with.</li>
<li>
		<strong>File Attachments</strong> - Webform Grants and Activities now have built-in support for native file attachments.</li>
</ul><h3>
	Try it out!</h3>
<p>You can test these new features by downloading the "dev" version of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_civicrm">Webform-CiviCRM 4</a> and going through the usual module upgrade procedure. This upgrade will alter your existing webform activity and case settings to work with the new features. I recommend trying it out on a test copy of your site and let me know if you spot any bugs. As soon as it's had a bit more testing and feedback we'll get these features into the next stable release of the module.</p>
