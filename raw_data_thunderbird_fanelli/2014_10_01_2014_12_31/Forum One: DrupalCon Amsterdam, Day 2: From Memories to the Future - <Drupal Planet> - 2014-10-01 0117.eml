<p>Today started out bright and early for our Forum One team, setting up for our part in the famous <a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Famsterdam2014.drupal.org%2Fprenote&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2pCV2dQR0NyPZxB3JUI0qi3tnew">DrupalCon Prenote</a>. This is one of the best-known “secrets” of DrupalCon. As Drupal founder Dries Buytaert puts it, “If you only get up early once during DrupalCon, this is the morning to do it.” In past years we’ve taught the audience how to pour beer (DrupalCon Munich), conducted the crowd in the “Drupal Opera” (DrupalCon Prague), and explored the funny and strange talents of the Drupal community (DrupalCon Portland). Of course, no one could forget our famous Coder/Themer Wonder Twins appearance at the Drupal Superheroes Prenote from DrupalCon Austin!</p>
<p>This year, the Prenote theme was Drupal memories. We heard from many of the famous Drupal core contributors about how they became involved in the community and how it ultimately changed their lives. A beautiful highlight was Nancy Beers sharing the romantic video her husband sent her from Drupal Camp in Seville, shortly after they met at DrupalCon in London. After showing the video, Nancy got down on one knee on stage and proposed!</p>
<p>Adam and I got to re-enact the founding of Acquia, one of Drupal’s biggest service providers. We re-enacted that first partnership between Dries Buytaert and Jay Batson in a great Star Wars-themed parody. “Join me, and together we can rule the Internets as CEO and CTO,” intoned Jay in a Darth Vader mask. The audience loved it, and, of course, Adam and I thoroughly enjoyed our parts as well.</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image011.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-4364 size-medium" src="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image011-250x166.jpg" alt="Campbell and Bryn Vertesi sing Drupal Memories" width="250" height="166" /></a>At the end of the reminiscing, we directed the audience to stand up and take &#8220;selfies&#8221; of themselves with the stage in the background, while the core contributors up front took their own &#8220;selfies&#8221; to match. Then I took the microphone with my opera singing, Drupalist wife, Bryn Vertesi, to sing a Drupal-lyrics version of “Memories”, from the musical CATS. “Once we’re Beta, you’ll understand what happiness is,” became the catchphrase for the day!</p>
<p><a class="image-link" href="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image021.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4365 size-large" src="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image021-700x393.jpg" alt="DrupalCon Selfies" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>The Dries keynote was exciting as well, mostly because of the announcement that Drupal 8 is going to Beta at the end of the convention! This is great news for developers and clients alike, as the Drupal 8 API brings enormous improvements in flexibility, scalability, and usability. Forum One’s own Kalpana Goel has been hard at work, not just helping to write Drupal 8, but mentoring others as well. She spent her day in the sprint room, where the core contributors mixed celebrating the milestone with planning sessions for the next development phase.</p>
<p><a class="image-link" href="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image031.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4366" src="http://forumone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image031-250x250.jpg" alt="image03" /></a></p>
<p>Today I also got to try out a new session, introducing the fundamental layout concepts in Drupal 7 and 8, and teaching people how to combine them for the best effect. <span class="c5" style="font-style: italic;">Panels, Display Suite, and Context &#8211; oh my!</span> ran overtime with a full room, and finally I decided we had to move the discussion to a “Birds of a Feather” workshop, tomorrow. I’m looking forward to it!</p>
<p>This was a long and eventful day for us here at DrupalCon Amsterdam. We’ll finish it off with a well-deserved beer at one of Holland’s famous breweries, hopefully somewhere along one of the many beautiful canals that dot this city. We’ll report back with more tomorrow!</p>
