    <p>Several times in the last few weeks, OSTraining students have asked us about maps in Drupal.</p>
<p>The students wanted to set up directories that would show Google maps for each location.</p>
<p>They also wanted to create larger maps that would display multiple locations at once.</p>
<p>We recommended that the students use the GMap module. However, although that module is powerful, it is poorly documented and can be confusing to use.</p>
<p>So, here's a beginners guide to the GMap module.</p><img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ostrainingdrupal/~4/8ZZ0FLFBycg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>
