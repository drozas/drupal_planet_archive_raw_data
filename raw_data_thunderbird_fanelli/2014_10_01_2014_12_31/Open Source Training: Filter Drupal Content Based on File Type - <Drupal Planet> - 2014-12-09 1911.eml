<p><img style="float: right;" src="https://www.ostraining.com/images/drupal/file-filter.png" alt="file filter" />One of our members asked an interesting question about Views.</p>
<p>They had a file field on their user profiles. In that field, the user could upload an image, an audio file, or link to a YouTube video. So far, so good. However, in Views, they only wanted to show that field if it contained a video.</p>
<p>Here's the solution to that problem. We're going to show you how to filter Drupal content based on the type of file that's attached to it.</p><img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ostrainingdrupal/~4/LS1hbvxnGHc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>
