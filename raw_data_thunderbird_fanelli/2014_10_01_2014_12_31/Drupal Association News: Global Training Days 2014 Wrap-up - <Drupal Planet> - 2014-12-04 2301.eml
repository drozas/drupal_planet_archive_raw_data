<p>Each quarter, communities and training companies host Introduction to Drupal sessions, building better and brighter community members. Global Training Days (GTD) is an opportunity for local training companies and community leaders to build their local community by offering low cost/free Introduction to Drupal training. The Drupal Association lists your training on our <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drupal.org%2Flearn-drupal&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHWHECreURplOl7urs6zdtMzfjhg">site</a>, promotes GTDs and is available to consult on planning and curriculum.   Offering these trainings has anecdotally shown to significantly grow individual participation in communities, build a pool of developers, and raise general awareness for the Drupal project. </p>
<p>This year 35 countries hosted over 170 low cost or free trainings. This year our Asian-Pacific communities really embraced GTDs! We had 8 Indian companies host trainings in Srinagar, Bangalore, Ghaziabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Gurgaon -- the most trainings in one individual country. China, South Korea, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan also hosted training sessions, really highlighting our growth and momentum in Asia-Pacific. </p>
<p>Feeling inspired?  Sign up to host a GTD at your DrupalCamp, meet-up, or your local user group.  Are you new to Drupal, or do you want to participate in an introductory training? Try reaching out to local Drupal training company to host an event.</p>
