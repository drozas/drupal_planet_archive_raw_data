The most common recommendation is to switch to NFS for shared folders.</p>
<p>NFS shared folders are a decent solution, and using NFS does indeed speed up performance quite a bit (usually on the order of 20-50x for a file-heavy framework like Drupal!). However, it has it's downsides: it requires extra effort to get running on Windows, requires NFS support inside the VM (not all Vagrant base boxes provide support by default), and is not actually all that fastâ€”in comparison to native filesystem performance.</p></div></div></div>
