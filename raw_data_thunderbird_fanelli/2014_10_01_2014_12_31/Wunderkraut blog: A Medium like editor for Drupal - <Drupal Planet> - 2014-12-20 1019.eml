    The editor used to edit posts at medium.com is a real slick, and I find it interesting and intuitive. Davi Ferreira have made an open source clone of it, so it could easily be used in other places.  </p>
<div class="field-ns-blog-post-body clearfix">
            <div class="field-item even"> <p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/cweagans">@cweagans</a> have done great work to get the <a href="https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor">Medium editor</a> in it's <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/medium">own module</a>, but I would rather myself have it inside the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg">WYSIWYG API</a>. so I took some parts of his work and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2070361#comment-9451419">did a patch</a>, so if somebody else finds it interesting to get this editor to work with WYSIWYG API, please try it out, test, review, throw stuff at it...</p><p>As a first step I just added the text editing part, with further plans on try it to get it to work with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/asset">Asset</a> for images, videos etc.</p> </div>
