    <p>Acquia Commons is a Drupal distribution that is for building communities within your organization. I have been able to play around with its competitor JIVE and must admit, it stands quite well next to it.</p>
<p>We were approached by Gary Conroy from Specsavers, who have introduced Commons within their organization and needed to do some additional tweaks to make it a bit similar to Facebook. This will be a series of two blog posts, in first we will show how we have made similar functionality to Facebook Like links and in the second how did we change the status form widget.</p>  </div>
